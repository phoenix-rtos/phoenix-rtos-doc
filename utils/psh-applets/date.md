# date

The `date` utility provided as a `psh` applet can be used to print or set system date and time.

---

If used with `-h` parameter it prints the help message with possible arguments and parameters as follows:

```bash
Usage: date [-h] [-s EPOCH] [-d @EPOCH] [+FORMAT]
  -h:  shows this help message
  -s:  set system time described by EPOCH (POSIX time format)
  -d:  display time described by EPOCH (POSIX time format)
  FORMAT: string with POSIX date formatting characters
NOTE: FORMAT string not supported by options: '-s', '-d'
```

## Date printing
To print current system date execute command without parameters. Default format of date is `<dayname, dd monthname yy hh:mm:ss>`:
```
(psh)% date
Thu, 01 Jan 70 00:00:01
(psh)%
```

Printing accepts `FORMAT` string that describes how or what part of date should be printed. Available formats are listed further in this document. Format string should start with `+` sign.
``` bash
(psh)% date +%H:%M:%S
00:02:34
(psh)%
```

## Date setting
To set date execute command with option `-s` and pass time in standard POSIX format (seconds since `Thu, 01 Jan 70 00:00:00`). Succesfull set of date prints newly set date.
```bash
(psh)% date -s 1630000000
Thu, 26 Aug 21 17:46:41
(psh)% date
Thu, 26 Aug 21 17:46:42
(psh)%
```

__Note:__ `-s` option temporarily does not support `FORMAT` string and it accepts

## Date parsing
To parse and print date without setting it execute command with option `-d` and pass `@EPOCH` parameter which is in standard POSIX time.
```bash
(psh)% date -d @1630000000
Thu, 26 Aug 21 17:46:41
(psh)%
```
