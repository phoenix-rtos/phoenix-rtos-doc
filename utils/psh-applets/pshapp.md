# pshapp

The interactive session of Phoenix Shell is itself an applet called `pshapp` **and is accessible using `psh`** command.
It delivers a commandline user interface together with a command interpreter.

For thorough documentation please refer to [psh documentation](psh.md), as `pshapp` is only a form of nesting the
command line utility in `psh`.
