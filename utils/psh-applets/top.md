# top

`top` is a real time processes and threads monitor which lists basic information about currently active processes.

---

`top` may be seen as [`ps`](ps.md) command which updates itself with a given rate. Execution of `top` applet may be controlled with command-line arguments and further with interactive commands when being 

When `top` is run with `-h` argument the help message is displayed as follows:
```
Command-line arguments
  -h:  prints help
  -H:  starts with threads mode
  -d:  sets refresh rate (integer greater than 0)
  -n:  sets number of iterations (by default its infinity)

Interactive commands:
   <ENTER> or <SPACE>:  refresh
   H:  toggle threads mode
   q:  quit
   P:  sort by CPU
   M:  sort by MEM
   T:  sort by TIME
   N:  sort by PID
   R:  reverse sorting
```

If sole:
```
top
``` 
is run it presents the user with a live monitor of processes sorted by *%CPU* usage. The monitor is structured in columns with headers. Each row represents a process.

Column headers are:
 - PID   - process id
 - PPID  - parent process id
 - PR    - priority
 - STATE - state of process
 - %CPU  - cpu usage of process
 - WAIT  - wait for processor time
 - TIME  - age of process
 - VMEM  - memory used
 - CMD   - command that started that process
