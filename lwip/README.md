# Network stack

Phoenix-RTOS network stack is based on LwIP. According to microkernel architecture philosophy, it works as a server on the user level and provides a socket interface. Sockets are implemented using the native Phoenix-RTOS message passing mechanism and are placed in the `libphoenix` library.
