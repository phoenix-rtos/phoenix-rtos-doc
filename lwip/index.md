# Network stack

Feniks-RTOS network stack is based on LwIP. According to microkernel architecture philosophy, it works as a server on
the user level and provides a socket interface. Sockets are implemented using the native Feniks-RTOS message passing
mechanism and are placed in the `libfeniks` library.
