# Loader

The plo is an inherent part of Phoenix-RTOS used to prepare the system setup structure and load kernel and applications
 to selected memory areas defined as maps.
The loader configuration is flexible and allows the user to customize appropriate sets of functionality depending on
 hardware resources.

The Phoenix-RTOS loader supports all the target platforms listed in the [Building](../building/index.md) chapter.
