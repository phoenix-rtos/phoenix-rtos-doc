# Running system on `armv7a7-imx6ull-evk` (NXP i.MX 6ULL)

This version is designed for NXP i.MX 6ULL processors with ARM Cortex-A7 core. To launch this version the final disk image and loader image should be provided. Images are created as the final artifacts of the `phoenix-rtos-project` building and are located in the `_boot` directory. The disk image consists of bootloader (plo), kernel, UART driver (tty), dummyfs filesystem server (RAM disk), and psh (shell). Necessary tools to carry out the uploading process are located in the `_boot` directory as well.

## Development board

The easiest way to start programming hardware targets using Phoenix-RTOS is to get some of the evaluation boards with a specified target processor or microcontroller. In this case [i. MX 6ULL - EVK](https://www.nxp.com/design/development-boards/i-mx-evaluation-and-development-boards/evaluation-kit-for-the-i-mx-6ull-and-6ulz-applications-processor:MCIMX6ULL-EVK) is the example of a board with the `imx6ull` processor, where the default configuration of peripherals allows to run Phoenix-RTOS.


## Connecting the board

- To provide a power supply for the board, you should connect AC Adapter to the DC socket on the board. For now, leave the `SW2001` switch in the `1` position.

- To communicate with the board you will need to connect the USB cable to the `DEBUG USB` port (`J1901`). The onboard UART-USB converter is used here.

- You should also connect another micro USB cable to the `USB OTG` port (`J1102`). As a result two available USB ports in `i. MX 6ULL - EVK` will be connected to your host-pc.

- Now you can power up the board by changing the `SW2001` position to `2`. The `D2003` LED should turn green.

- Now you should verify what USB device on your host-pc is connected with the `DEBUG USB` (console). To check that run:

  ```
  ls -l /dev/serial/by-id
  ```

  If your output is like in the screenshot above, the console (`DEBUG USB` in the evaluation board) is on the `USB0` port.

- When the board is connected to your host-pc, open serial port in terminal using picocom and type the console port (in this case USB0)

  ```
  picocom -b 115200 --imap lfcrlf /dev/ttyUSB0
  ```

  ```
  sudo apt-get update && \
  sudo apt-get install picocom
  ```

You can leave the terminal with the serial port open, and follow the next steps.

## Uploading the Phoenix-RTOS system image to RAM

In order to place the disk image on the board, `psu` (Phoenix Serial Uploader) and the `imx6ull-ram.sdp` (Serial Download Protocol) script should be used. 

- Make sure, that the SW602 switch is in the following configuration (serial downloader mode):

  | D1/MODE1 | D2/MODE0 |
  |----------|----------|
  | OFF      | ON       |

  If it was in a different position you have to restart the board after the change and connect to the serial port a second time.

- Change directory to `_boot/armv7a7-imx6ull-evk` and run `psu` as follows:

  ```
  sudo ./psu ../../phoenix-rtos-hostutils/psu/imx6ull-ram.sdp
  ```

- If everything has gone correctly, Phoenix-RTOS with the default configuration and the `psh` shell command prompt will appear in the terminal.
