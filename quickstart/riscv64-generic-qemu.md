# Running system on `riscv64-generic-qemu`
This version is designated for RISC-V 64 processor based virt machine implemented by `qemu-system-riscv64`. To launch this version two files should be provided - kernel file integrated with SBI firmware with embedded UART16550 interface driver, dummyfs filesystem and the`psh` shell and disk image with ext2 filesystem.

The files are created as the final artifact of the `phoenix-rtos-project` building and are located in the `_boot` directory. See [how to build the Phoenix-RTOS system image](../building/README.md).

## Running image under qemu
Firstly, you need to install qemu emulator.
