# Running system on <nobr>riscv64-generic-qemu</nobr>

This version is designated for RISC-V 64 processors based virtual machine implemented by `qemu-system-riscv64`.
To launch this version two files should be provided - `phoenix.disk` file integrated with SBI firmware with embedded
PLO, kernel, UART16550 interface and virtio-blk drivers, dummyfs filesystem and the `psh` shell and `rootfs.disk` image
with the ext2 filesystem.

The files are created as the final artifact of the `phoenix-rtos-project` building and are located in the `_boot`
directory. See [how to build the Phoenix-RTOS system image](../building/index.md).

## Running image under QEMU
