# Running system on `armv7m7-imxrt106x-evk` (NXP i.MX RT106x)

This version is designed for NXP i.MX RT106x processors with ARM Cortex-M7 core. To launch this version the final disk image and loader image should be provided. The images are created as the final artifacts of the `phoenix-rtos-project` building and are located in the `_boot` directory. The disk image consists of the bootloader (plo), kernel, UART driver (tty), dummyfs filesystem server (RAM disk), and psh (shell). Necessary tools to carry out the flashing process are located in the `_boot` directory as well.

See [how to build the Phoenix-RTOS system image](../building/README.md).

## Development board

The easiest way to start programming hardware targets using Phoenix-RTOS is to get some of the evaluation boards with a specified target processor or microcontroller. In this case [i. MX RT1064 - EVK](https://www.nxp.com/design/development-boards/i-mx-evaluation-and-development-boards/mimxrt1064-evk-i-mx-rt1064-evaluation-kit:MIMXRT1064-EVK) is the example of a board with the `imxrt106x` processor, where the default configuration of peripherals allows to run Phoenix-RTOS.

## Connecting the board

- Firstly make sure, that the `J1` jumper is in a `3-4` position so that the power will be supplied from the `USB OTG` port. This is the simplest way, but the good practice is using a USB hub. You can provide power using an AC adapter and DC connector too (1-2 jumper position).

- To provide a power supply for the board and make flashing possible, you should connect a USB to micro USB cable between your host pc and `USB OTG` (`J9`) of the development board. Do it first.

- To communicate with the board you will need to connect another USB cable, but to `DEBUG USB` port (`J14`). The onboard UART-USB converter is used here.

- Now you should verify what USB device on your host-pc is connected with the `DEBUG USB` (console). To check that run:

  ```bash
  ls -l /dev/serial/by-id
  ```

  </br>

  If your output is like in the screenshot above, the console (`DEBUG USB` in the evaluation board) is on the `ACM0` port.

- When the board is connected to your host-pc, open serial port in terminal using picocom and type the console port (in this case ACM0)

  ```
  picocom -b 115200 --imap lfcrlf /dev/ttyACM0
  ```

  <summary>How to get picocom (Ubuntu 20.04)</summary>

  ```
  sudo apt-get update && \
  sudo apt-get install picocom
  ```

You can leave the terminal with the serial port open, and follow the next steps.
## Flashing the Phoenix-RTOS system image

The process comes down to a few steps, described below.

### Uploading Phoenix-RTOS loader (PLO) to the RAM

In order to flash the disk image to the board, the bootloader (plo) image located in the `_boot` directory should be uploaded to the RAM using `psu` (Phoenix Serial Uploader) via `SDP` (Serial Download Protocol).

NOTE: i. MX RT1064 should be set in Serial Download mode. Set the appropriate configuration of SW7 switch on i. MX RT1064 - EVK, which is `0001`. If the configuration was different you should restart the board after the change and open the serial port using picocom once again.

Change directory to `_boot/armv7m7-imxrt106x-evk` and run `psu` as follow:

```
cd _boot/armv7m7-imxrt106x-evk
```

```bash
sudo ./psu plo-ram.sdp
```

The plo user interface should appear in the console.

### Copying flash image using PHFS (phoenixd)

To flash the disk image, first, you need to verify on which port plo USB device has been appeared. You can check that using `ls` as follow:
```bash
ls -l /dev/serial/by-id
```
<img src="_images/imxrt106x-ls-2.png" width="700px">

To share disk image to the bootloader, `phoenixd` has to be launched with the following arguments (choose suitable ttyACMx device, in this case, ttyACM1):

```bash
sudo ./phoenixd -p /dev/ttyACM1 -b 115200 -s .
```
<img src="_images/imxrt106x-phoenixd.png" width="700px">

To start copying a file, write the following command in the console with plo interface:

```bash
copy usb0 phoenix.disk flash1 0x0 0x0
```

The `flash1` is the internal flash memory. The alternative option is to copy the system image to external flash memory - `flash0`.

### Booting Phoenix-RTOS from internal Flash

To launch Phoenix-RTOS from flash memory, change SW7 switch to Internal Flash mode (`0010` configuration) and restart the board (you can do it by pushing the `SW3` button).

If everything has gone correctly, Phoenix-RTOS with the default configuration and the `psh` shell command prompt will appear in the terminal after 2 seconds. If there is a need to enter the bootloader, the waiting for input should be interrupted by pressing any key. Then you can exit plo by passing `go!` command.
