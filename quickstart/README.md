# Running system on targets

This chapter presents how to run Phoenix-RTOS on supported targets. It is assumed that `phoenix-rtos-project` is built and building artifacts are available in the `_boot` directory. The building process has been described in [phoenix-rtos-doc/building](../building/README.md).
