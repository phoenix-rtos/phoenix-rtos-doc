# USB stack
Devices running Phoenix-RTOS can act as both sides of USB communication - host and device (client). When acting as a host, the USB stack is implemented as a server called simply `usb`, which communicates with specific device `drivers` using messages. Those `drivers` are separate processes and implement class or device specific communication layers. In order to simplify adding new device drivers `libusb` is used, more precisely functions found in `driver.h` header. Drivers for specific device classes can be found in the `phoenix-rtos-devices` repository.

When we want Phoenix-RTOS device to act as a device side of the communication, we need to link both `libusb` and `libusbclient` to our program and no additional server applications are needed. `libusbclient` is responsible for implementing platform specific details of communicating with USB hardware and is built using `phoenix-rtos-devices` repository.

The `phoenix-rtos-usb` repository contains two directories, that match two build targets: `libusb` and `usb`.


## Source code

The source code of the USB host stack and libusb can be obtained with the following command:
