# Ports

Open-source tools adapted to Phoenix-RTOS are called ports. A source code of each port is downloaded from its official website as an archive file.
Next, the file is unpacked and compiled using the [Phoenix-RTOS toolchain](../building/toolchain.md). All these steps are performed during a building process when the ports component is specified. Read more about building components in the [building script](../building/script.md) chapter.

The [phoenix-rtos-ports](https://github.com/phoenix-rtos/phoenix-rtos-ports) repository mostly consists of specific building scripts and patches for each tool.
If you don't know what are `phoenix-rtos` repositories you can check the [reference project repository](../building/project.md) chapter.

## Components

Following ports are possible to use:

- `busybox` - application suite that provides several UN*X utilities,
- `curl` - command-line tool for transferring data using various network protocols,
- `dropbear` - package that that provides SSH-compatible server and client,
- `jansson` - library for encoding, decoding and manipulating JSON data,
- `libevent`-  library that provides asynchronous event notification,
- `lighttpd`- web server optimized for speed-critical environments,
- `lua` - programming language designed primarily for embedded use in applications,
- `lzo` - portable lossless data compression library,
- [mbedtls](mbedtls.md) - an open source, portable, easy to use SSL library,
- `micropython` - lean and efficient implementation of the Python 3 programming language,
- `openssl`- toolkit for general-purpose cryptography and secure communication,
- `openvpn`- open source connection protocol used to facilitate a secure tunnel between two points in a network,
- `pcre` - library that implements regular expression pattern matching using the same syntax and semantics as Perl 5,
- `scep` - client-only implementation of the `SCEP` (Cisco System's Simple Certificate Enrollment Protocol),
- `wpa_supplicant` - Wi-Fi Protected Access client and `IEEE 802.1X` supplicant
- [azure_sdk](azure_sdk.md) - Azure IoT C Software Development Kit
