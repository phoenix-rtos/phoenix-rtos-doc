# Synopsis 
`#include <stdio.h>`</br>

` char *gets(char *s); `</br>

## Status
Partially implemented
## Conformance
IEEE Std 1003.1-2017
## Description


The purpose is to get a string from a stdin stream. The `gets()` function shall read bytes from the standard input stream, `stdin`, into the array pointed to by _s_,
until a `<newline>` is read or an end-of-file condition is encountered. Any `<newline>` shall be discarded and a `null` byte
shall be placed immediately after the last byte read into the array.
The
`gets()` function may mark the last data access timestamp of the file associated with stream for update. The last data
access timestamp shall be marked for update by the first successful execution of `fgetc()`, `fgets()`, `fread()`, `fscanf()`, `getc()`, `getchar()`, `getdelim()`, `getline()`, `gets()`, or `scanf()` using stream that returns data not supplied by a prior call to `ungetc()`. 


## Return value


Upon successful completion, `gets()` shall return _s_. If the end-of-file indicator for the stream is set, or if the stream is at end-of-file, the end-of-file indicator for the stream shall be set and `gets()` shall return a `null` pointer. If a read error occurs, the error indicator for the stream shall be set, `gets()` shall return a `null` pointer, and set `errno` to indicate the error.


## Errors


Refer to [fgetc](../f/fgetc.part-impl.md).
