# Synopsis 
`#include <unistd.h>`</br>

` char *getcwd(char *buf, size_t size);`</br>

## Status
Partially implemented
## Conformance
IEEE Std 1003.1-2017
## Description


The purpose is to get the `pathname` of the current working directory. The `getcwd()` function shall place an absolute `pathname` of the current working directory in the array pointed to by
_buf_, and return _buf_. The `pathname` shall contain no components that are dot or dot-dot, or are symbolic links.

If there are multiple `pathnames` that `getcwd()` could place in the array pointed to by _buf_, one beginning with a
single `<slash>` character and one or more beginning with two `<slash>` characters, then `getcwd()` shall place the
`pathname` beginning with a single `<slash>` character in the array. The `pathname` shall not contain any unnecessary `<slash>`
characters after the leading one or two `<slash>` characters.

The _size_ argument is the size in bytes of the character array pointed to by the _buf_ argument. If _buf_ is a
`null` pointer, the behavior of `getcwd()` is unspecified.


## Return value

Upon successful completion, `getcwd()` shall return the _buf_ argument. Otherwise, `getcwd()` shall return a `null` pointer and set `errno` to indicate the error. The contents of the array pointed to by _buf_ are then undefined.

## Errors


The `getcwd()` function shall fail if:


 * `EINVAL` - The _size_ argument is `0`.

 * `ERANGE` - The _size_ argument is greater than `0`, but is smaller than the length of the `string + 1`.

The `getcwd()` function may fail if:


 * `EACCES` - Search permission was denied for the current directory, or read or search permission was denied for a directory above the
current directory in the file hierarchy.

 * `ENOMEM` - Insufficient storage space is available.
