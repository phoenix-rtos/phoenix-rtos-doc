## Status

## Conformance
IEEE Std 1003.1-2017
## Description


The purpose is to read a delimited record from stream. The `getdelim()` function shall read from _stream_ until it encounters a character matching the delimiter
character. The _delimiter_ argument is an `int`, the value of which the application shall ensure is a character
representable as an `unsigned` `char` of equal value that terminates the read process. If the _delimiter_ argument has any
other value, the behavior is undefined.

The application shall ensure that _`*lineptr`_ is a valid argument that could be passed to the `free()` function. If _`*n`_ is non-zero, the application shall ensure that _`*lineptr`_
either points to an object of size at least _`*n`_ bytes, or is a `null` pointer.

If _`*lineptr`_ is a `null` pointer or if the object pointed to by _`*lineptr`_ is of insufficient size, an object shall be
allocated as if by `malloc()` or the object shall be reallocated as if by `realloc()`, respectively, such that the object is large enough to hold the characters to be
written to it, including the terminating `NUL`, and _`*n`_ shall be set to the new size. If the object was allocated, or if the
reallocation operation moved the object, _`*lineptr`_ shall be updated to point to the new object or new location. The
characters read, including any delimiter, shall be stored in the object, and a terminating `NUL` added when the _delimiter_ or
end-of-file is encountered.

The `getline()` function shall be equivalent to the `getdelim()` function with the delimiter character equal to
the `<newline>` character.

The `getdelim()` and `getline()` functions may mark the last data access timestamp of the file associated with
_stream_ for update. The last data access timestamp shall be marked for update by the first successful execution of `fgetc()`, `fgets()`, `fread()`, `fscanf()`, `getc()`, `getchar()`, `getdelim()`,
`getline()`, `gets()`, or `scanf()` using
_stream_ that returns data not supplied by a prior call to `ungetc()`.


## Return value


Upon successful completion, the `getline()` and `getdelim()` functions shall return the number of bytes written into
the buffer, including the _delimiter_ character if one was encountered before `EOF`, but excluding the terminating `NUL` character. If
the end-of-file indicator for the _stream_ is set, or if no characters were read and the _stream_ is at end-of-file, the end-of-file
indicator for the _stream_ shall be set and the function shall return `-1`. If an error occurs, the error indicator for the _stream_
shall be set, and the function shall return `-1` and set `errno` to indicate the error.

## Errors


For the conditions under which the `getdelim()` and `getline()` functions shall fail and may fail, refer to [fgetc](../f/fgetc.part-impl.md).

In addition, these functions shall fail if:

 * `EINVAL` - _lineptr_ or _n_ is a `null` pointer.

 * `ENOMEM` - Insufficient memory is available.

These functions may fail if:

 * `EOVERFLOW` - The number of bytes to be written into the buffer, including the _delimiter_ character (if encountered), would exceed
`SSIZE_MAX`.
