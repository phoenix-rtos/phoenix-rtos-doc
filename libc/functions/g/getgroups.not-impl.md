# Synopsis 
`#include <unistd.h>`

` int getgroups(int gidsetsize, gid_t grouplist[]);`


## Status
Declared, not implemented
## Conformance
IEEE Std 1003.1-2017
## Description


The `getgroups()` function shall fill in the array _grouplist_ with the current supplementary group IDs of the calling
process. It is implementation-defined whether `getgroups()` also returns the effective group ID in the _grouplist_
array.

The _gidsetsize_ argument specifies the number of elements in the array _grouplist_. The actual number of group IDs
stored in the array shall be returned. The values of array entries with indices greater than or equal to the value returned are
undefined.

If _gidsetsize_ is 0, `getgroups()` shall return the number of group IDs that it would otherwise return without
modifying the array pointed to by _grouplist_.

If the effective group ID of the process is returned with the supplementary group IDs, the value returned shall always be
greater than or equal to one and less than or equal to the value of `NGROUPS_MAX`+1.


## Return value


Upon successful completion, the number of supplementary group IDs shall be returned. A return value of -1 indicates failure and
errno shall be set to indicate the error.


## Errors


The `getgroups()` function shall fail if:


 * `EINVAL` - The _gidsetsize_ argument is non-zero and less than the number of group IDs that would have been returned.





## Tests

Untested

## Known bugs
