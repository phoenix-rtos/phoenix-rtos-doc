# Synopsis 
`#include <stdio.h>`</br>

` int getc(FILE *stream);`</br>

## Status
Partially implemented
## Conformance
IEEE Std 1003.1-2017
## Description


The purpose is to get a byte from a stream. The `getc()` function shall be equivalent to `fgetc`, except that if it is
implemented as a macro it may evaluate stream more than once, so the argument should never be an expression with
side-effects.


## Return value


Refer to [fgetc](../f/fgetc.part-impl.md).


## Errors


Refer to [fgetc](../f/fgetc.part-impl.md).




## Tests

Untested

## Known bugs

None
