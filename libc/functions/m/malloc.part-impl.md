` void *malloc(size_t size);`</br>

## Status
Partially implemented
## Conformance
IEEE Std 1003.1-2017
## Description

The `malloc()` function shall allocate unused space for an object whose size in bytes is specified by _size_ and whose
value is unspecified.

The order and contiguity of storage allocated by successive calls to `malloc()` is unspecified. The pointer returned if the
allocation succeeds shall be suitably aligned so that it may be assigned to a pointer to any type of object and then used to access
such an object in the space allocated (until the space is explicitly freed or reallocated). Each such allocation shall yield a
pointer to an object disjoint from any other object. The pointer returned points to the start (lowest byte address) of the
allocated space. If the space cannot be allocated, a null pointer shall be returned. If the _size_ of the space requested is `0`, the
behavior is implementation-defined: either a null pointer shall be returned, or the behavior shall be as if the _size_ were some
non-zero value, except that the behavior is undefined if the returned pointer is used to access an object.


## Return value


Upon successful completion with _size_ not equal to `0`, `malloc()` shall return a pointer to the allocated space. If
_size_ is 0, either:



* A null pointer shall be returned    and `errno` may be set to an implementation-defined value,  or





* A pointer to the allocated space shall be returned. The application shall ensure that the pointer is not used to access an object.




Otherwise, it shall return a null pointer and set `errno` to indicate the error. 


## Errors


The `malloc()` function shall fail if:


 * `ENOMEM` - Insufficient storage space is available.
