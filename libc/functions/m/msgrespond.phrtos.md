# Synopsis 
`#include <sys/msg.h>`

`int msgRespond(uint32_t port, msg_t *m, unsigned long int rid);`

## Status
Implemented
## Conformance
Phoenix-RTOS specific
## Description

Finishes the communication between processes by responding to sender of initial message _msg_ with modified output buffer to _port_ from which the message was read. Response ID _rid_ specifies message context and should be passed from _rid_ acquired via `msgRecv()` call.

This function is part of interprocess communicaition mechanisms in Phoenix-RTOS. For more information about messaging process and `msg_t` message structure please refer to [Message Passing](../../../kernel/proc/msg.md).


## Return value

If an error occurs during a function call an error value shall be returned. Otherwise returns `0`.

## Errors

This function shall fall if:

 * `-EINVAL` - _port_ does not name an existing port, or _port_ is closed

## Tests

Untested

## Known bugs

 - Does not check if message pointer _m_ is not `NULL`.
