# Synopsis 
`#include <string.h>`</br>

` void *memchr(const void *s, int c, size_t n);`</br>

## Status
Partially implemented
## Conformance
IEEE Std 1003.1-2017
## Description


The `memchr()` function shall locate the first occurrence of _c_ (converted to an unsigned char) in the initial
_n_ bytes (each interpreted as unsigned char) pointed to by s.

Implementations shall behave as if they read the memory byte by byte from the beginning of the bytes pointed to by s and
stop at the first occurrence of _c_ (if it is found in the initial n bytes).


## Return value


The `memchr()` function shall return a pointer to the located byte, or a `null` pointer if the byte is not found.


## Errors


No errors are defined.




## Tests

Untested

## Known bugs
