## Description 
 
`wcstombs()` - convert a wide-character string to a character string

The `wcstombs()` function shall convert the sequence of wide-character codes that are in the array pointed to by pwcs into a sequence of characters that begins in the initial shift state and store these characters into the array pointed to by _s_, stopping if a character would exceed the limit of _n_ total bytes or if a null byte is stored. Each wide-character code shall be converted as if by a call to `wctomb()`, except that the shift state of `wctomb()` shall not be affected.

The behavior of this function shall be affected by the `LC_CTYPE` category of the current locale.

No more than _n_ bytes shall be modified in the array pointed to by _s_. If copying takes place between objects that overlap, the behavior is undefined. If _s_ is a `null` pointer, `wcstombs()` shall return the length required to convert the entire array regardless of the value of _n_, but no values are stored.

## Return value

If a wide-character code is encountered that does not correspond to a valid character (of one or more bytes each), `wcstombs()` shall return `(size_t)-1`. Otherwise, `wcstombs()` shall return the number of bytes stored in the character array, not including any terminating `null` byte. The array shall not be `null`-terminated if the value returned is _n_.

<!-- #MUST_BE: check what errors can cause the function to fail  -->
## Errors

The `wcstombs()` function shall fail if:

* `EILSEQ` - a wide-character code does not correspond to a valid character. 

<!-- #MUST_BE: function by default shall be untested, when tested there should be a link to test location and test command for ia32 test runner  -->
## Tests

Untested
