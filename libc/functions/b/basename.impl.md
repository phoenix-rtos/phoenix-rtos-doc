# Synopsis

`#include <libgen.h>`

`char *basename(char *path);`

## Description

The `basename()` function takes the path name pointed to by _path_ and returns a pointer to the final component of
the path name, deleting any trailing '/' characters.

Arguments:
_path_ - the path name to be stripped.

If the string pointed to by _path_ consists entirely of the '/' character, `basename()` returns a pointer to the
string "/". If the string pointed to by _path_ is exactly "//", "/" is returned.

If _path_ is a null pointer or points to an empty string, `basename()` returns a pointer to the string ".".

## Return value

The `basename()` function shall return a pointer to the final component of _path_.

## Errors

No errors are defined.
