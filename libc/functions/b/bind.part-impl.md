# Synopsis

`#include <sys/socket.h>`

`int bind(int socket, const struct sockaddr *address, socklen_t address_len);`

## Status

Partially implemented.

## Conformance

IEEE Std 1003.1-2017

## Description

The `bind()` function binds a name to socket `socket`.

### Arguments

`socket` - the file descriptor of the socket.

`address` - the pointer to a sockaddr structure containing the address to be bound to the socket. The length and format
of the address depend on the address family of the socket.

`address_len` - the length of the `sockaddr` structure pointed to by the `address` argument.

The `bind()` function assigns a local socket address `address` to a socket identified by descriptor `socket` that has no
local socket address assigned. Sockets created with the `socket()` function are initially unnamed; they are identified
only by their address family.

## Return value

`0` on successful completion,

`-1` otherwise (`errno` is set then adequately)

## Errors

[`EADDRINUSE`] - the specified address is already in use.

[`EADDRNOTAVAIL`] - the specified address is not available from the local machine.

[`EAFNOSUPPORT`] - the specified address is not a valid address for the address family of the specified socket.

[`EALREADY`] - an assignment request is already in progress for the specified socket.

[`EBADF`] - the socket argument is not a valid file descriptor.

[`EINPROGRESS`] - `O_NONBLOCK` is set for the file descriptor for the socket and the assignment cannot be immediately
performed; the assignment is performed asynchronously.

[`EINVAL`] - the socket is already bound to an address, and the protocol does not support binding to a new address, or
the socket has been shut down.

[`ENOBUFS`] - insufficient resources were available to complete the call.

[`ENOTSOCK`] - the socket argument does not refer to a socket.

[`EOPNOTSUPP`] - the socket type of the specified socket does not support binding to an address.

[`EACCES`] - the specified address is protected, and the current user does not have permission to bind to it.

[`EINVAL`] - the `address_len` argument is not a valid length for the address family.

[`EISCONN`] - the socket is already connected.

[`ELOOP`] - more than {`SYMLOOP_MAX`} symbolic links were encountered during resolution of the path name in `address<`.

[`ENAMETOOLONG`] - the length of a path name exceeds {`PATH_MAX`}, or path name resolution of a symbolic link produced
an intermediate result with a length that exceeds {`PATH_MAX`}.

If the address family of the socket is `AF_UNIX`, then `bind()` fails if:

[`EACCES`] - a component of the path prefix denies search permission, or the requested name requires writing in a
directory with a mode that denies write permission.

[`EDESTADDRREQ`] or [`EISDIR`] - the `address` argument is a null pointer.

[`EIO`] - an I/O error occurred.

[`ELOOP`] - a loop exists in symbolic links encountered during resolution of the path name in `address`.

[`ENAMETOOLONG`] - the length of a component of a path name is longer than {`NAME_MAX`}.

[`ENOENT`] - a component of the path prefix of the path name in `address` does not name an existing file or the path
name is an empty string.

[`ENOENT`] or [`ENOTDIR`] - the path name in `address` contains at least one non- / character and ends with one or more
trailing / characters. If the path name without the trailing / characters would name an existing file,
a [`ENOENT`] error shall not occur.

[`ENOTDIR`] - a component of the path prefix of the path name in `address` names an existing file that is neither a
directory nor a symbolic link to a directory, or the path name in `address` contains at least one non- / character and
ends with one or more trailing / characters and the last path name component names an existing file that is neither a
directory nor a symbolic link to a directory.

[`EROFS`] - the name would reside on a read-only file system.
