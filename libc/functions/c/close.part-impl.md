` int close(int fildes);`</br>

## Status
Partially implemented
## Conformance
IEEE Std 1003.1-2017
## Description


The purpose is to close a file descriptor. The `close()` function shall deallocate the file descriptor indicated by _fildes_. To deallocate means to make the
file descriptor available for return by subsequent calls to `open()` or other functions
that allocate file descriptors. All outstanding record locks owned by the process on the file associated with the file descriptor
shall be removed (that is, unlocked).

If `close()` is interrupted by a signal that is to be caught, it shall return `-1` with `errno` set to `EINTR` and the
state of _fildes_ is unspecified. If an `I/O` error occurred while reading from or writing to the file system during
`close()`, it may return `-1` with errno set to `EIO`, if this error is returned, the state of _fildes_ is
unspecified.

When all file descriptors associated with a pipe or `FIFO` special file are closed, any data remaining in the pipe or `FIFO` shall
be discarded.

When all file descriptors associated with an open file description have been closed, the open file description shall be
freed.

If the link count of the file is `0`, when all file descriptors associated with the file are closed, the space occupied by the
file shall be freed and the file shall no longer be accessible.
If a `STREAMS`-based _fildes_ is closed and the calling process was previously registered to receive a SIGPOLL signal for
events associated with that `STREAM`, the calling process shall be unregistered for events associated with the `STREAM`. The last
`close()` for a `STREAM` shall cause the `STREAM` associated with _fildes_ to be dismantled. If `O_NONBLOCK` is not set and
there have been no signals posted for the `STREAM`, and if there is data on the module's write queue, `close()` shall wait for
an unspecified time (for each module and driver) for any output to drain before dismantling the `STREAM`. The time delay can be
changed via an `I_SETCLTIME` `ioctl()` request. If the `O_NONBLOCK` flag is set, or if there
are any pending signals, `close()` shall not wait for output to drain, and shall dismantle the `STREAM` immediately.

If the implementation supports `STREAMS`-based pipes, and _fildes_ is associated with one end of a pipe, the last
`close()` shall cause a hangup to occur on the other end of the pipe. In addition, if the other end of the pipe has been named
by `fattach()`, then the last `close()` shall force the named end to be detached
by `fdetach()`. If the named end has no open file descriptors associated with it and
gets detached, the STREAM associated with that end shall also be dismantled. 
If _fildes_ refers to the master side of a pseudo-terminal, and this is the last close, a `SIGHUP` signal shall be sent to the
controlling process, if any, for which the slave side of the pseudo-terminal is the controlling terminal. It is unspecified whether
closing the master side of the pseudo-terminal flushes all queued input and output. 
If _fildes_ refers to the slave side of a `STREAMS`-based pseudo-terminal, a zero-length message may be sent to the master.

When there is an outstanding cancelable asynchronous `I/O` operation against _fildes_ when `close()` is called, that `I/O`
operation may be canceled. An `I/O` operation that is not canceled completes as if the `close()` operation had not yet occurred.

All operations that are not canceled shall complete as if the `close()` blocked until the operations completed. The
`close()` operation itself need not block awaiting such `I/O` completion. Whether any `I/O` operation is canceled, and which `I/O`
operation may be canceled upon `close()`, is implementation-defined.

If a memory mapped file or a shared memory object 
remains referenced at the last close (that is, a process has it mapped), then the entire contents of the memory object shall
persist until the memory object becomes unreferenced. If this is the last close of a memory mapped file or a shared
memory object  Â and the close results in the memory object
becoming unreferenced, and the memory object has been unlinked, then the memory object shall be removed.

If _fildes_ refers to a socket, `close()` shall cause the socket to be destroyed. If the socket is in connection-mode,
and the `SO_LINGER` option is set for the socket with non-zero linger time, and the socket has untransmitted data, then
`close()` shall block for up to the current linger interval until all data is transmitted.


## Return value

Upon successful completion, `0` shall be returned, otherwise, `-1` shall be returned and `errno` set to indicate the error.

## Errors


The `close()` function shall fail if:


 * `EBADF` - The _fildes_ argument is not a open file descriptor.

 * `EINTR` - The `close()` function was interrupted by a signal.

The `close()` function may fail if:


 * `EIO` - An I/O error occurred while reading from or writing to the file system.
