IEEE Std 1003.1-2017

## Description


The purpose is to connect a socket. The `connect()` function shall attempt to make a connection on a connection-mode socket or to set or reset the peer address
of a connectionless-mode socket. The function takes the following arguments:

* _`socket`_ - Specifies the file descriptor associated with the _socket_.
* _`address`_ - Points to a sockaddr structure containing the peer address. The length and format of the address depend on the address
family of the socket.
* _`address_len`_ - Specifies the length of the sockaddr structure pointed to by the _address_ argument.

If the socket has not already been bound to a local address, `connect()` shall bind it to an address which, unless the
socket's address family is `AF_UNIX,` is an unused local address.

If the initiating socket is not connection-mode, then `connect()` shall set the socket's peer address, and no connection is
made. For `SOCK_DGRAM` sockets, the peer address identifies where all datagrams are sent on subsequent `send()` functions, and limits the remote sender for subsequent `recv()` functions. If the `sa_family` member of address is `AF_UNSPEC,` the socket's
peer address shall be reset. Note that despite no connection being made, the term `connected` is used to describe a
connectionless-mode socket for which a peer address has been set.

If the initiating socket is connection-mode, then `connect()` shall attempt to establish a connection to the address
specified by the _address_ argument. If the connection cannot be established immediately and `O_NONBLOCK` is not set for the
file descriptor for the socket, `connect()` shall block for up to an unspecified timeout interval until the connection is
established. If the timeout interval expires before the connection is established, `connect()` shall fail and the connection
attempt shall be aborted. If `connect()` is interrupted by a signal that is caught while blocked waiting to establish a
connection, `connect()` shall fail and set errno to `EINTR`, but the connection request shall not be aborted, and the
connection shall be established asynchronously.

If the connection cannot be established immediately and `O_NONBLOCK` is set for the file descriptor for the socket,
`connect()` shall fail and set `errno` to `EINPROGRESS`, but the connection request shall not be aborted, and the
connection shall be established asynchronously. Subsequent calls to `connect()` for the same socket, before the connection is
established, shall fail and set `errno` to `EALREADY`.

When the connection has been established asynchronously, `pselect()`, `select()`, and `poll()` shall indicate that the file
descriptor for the socket is ready for writing.

The socket in use may require the process to have appropriate privileges to use the `connect()` function.


## Return value

Upon successful completion, `connect()` shall return `0`, otherwise, `-1` shall be returned and `errno` set to indicate the error.

## Errors


The `connect()` function shall fail if:

* `EADDRNOTAVAIL`- The specified address is not available from the local machine.

* `EAFNOSUPPORT` - The specified address is not a valid address for the address family of the specified socket.

 * `EALREADY` - A connection request is already in progress for the specified socket.

 * `EBADF` - The _socket_ argument is not a valid file descriptor.

 * `ECONNREFUSED` - The target address was not listening for connections or refused the connection request.

 * `EINPROGRESS` - `O_NONBLOCK` is set for the file descriptor for the socket and the connection cannot be immediately established, the connection
shall be established asynchronously.

 * `EINTR` - The attempt to establish a connection was interrupted by delivery of a signal that was caught, the connection shall be
established asynchronously.

 * `EISCONN` - The specified socket is connection-mode and is already connected.

 * `ENETUNREACH` - No route to the network is present.

 * `ENOTSOCK` - The _socket_ argument does not refer to a socket.

 * `EPROTOTYPE` - The specified address has a different type than the socket bound to the specified peer address.

 * `ETIMEDOUT` - The attempt to connect timed out before a connection was made.

If the address family of the socket is `AF_UNIX`, then `connect()` shall fail if:

 * `EIO` - An `I/O` error occurred while reading from or writing to the file system.

 * `ELOOP` - A loop exists in symbolic links encountered during resolution of the pathname in _address_.

 * `ENAMETOOLONG` - The length of a component of a pathname is longer than `NAME_MAX`.

 * `ENOENT` - A component of the pathname does not name an existing file or the pathname is an empty string.

 * `ENOTDIR` - A component of the path prefix of the pathname in _address_ names an existing file that is neither a directory nor a
symbolic link to a directory, or the pathname in _address_ contains at least one non-`<slash>` character and ends with
one or more trailing `<slash>` characters and the last pathname component names an existing file that is neither a directory
nor a symbolic link to a directory.

The `connect()` function may fail if:


 * `EACCES` - Search permission is denied for a component of the path prefix, or write access to the named socket is denied.

 * `EADDRINUSE` - Attempt to establish a connection that uses addresses that are already in use.

 * `ECONNRESET` - Remote host reset the connection request.

 * `EHOSTUNREACH` - The destination host cannot be reached (probably because the host is down or a remote router cannot reach it).

 * `EINVAL` - The _address_len_ argument is not a valid length for the address family; or invalid address family in the sockaddr
structure.

 * `ELOOP` - More than `SYMLOOP_MAX` symbolic links were encountered during resolution of the pathname in _address_.

 * `ENAMETOOLONG` - The length of a pathname exceeds `PATH_MAX`, or pathname resolution of a symbolic link produced an intermediate result with a
length that exceeds `PATH_MAX`.

 * `ENETDOWN` - The local network interface used to reach the destination is down.

 * `ENOBUFS` - No buffer space is available.

 * `EOPNOTSUPP` - The socket is listening and cannot be connected.
