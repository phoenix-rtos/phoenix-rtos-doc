# Synopsis 
`#include <math.h>`</br>

` double ceil(double x);`</br>

` float ceilf(float x);`</br>

## Status
Partially implemented
## Conformance
IEEE Std 1003.1-2017
## Description


These functions shall compute the smallest integral value not less than _x_.


## Return value

The result shall have the same sign as _x_.

Upon successful completion, `ceil()` and `ceilf()` shall return the smallest integral value not less than _x_, expressed as a type double, float, or long double, respectively.

* If _x_ is `NaN`, a `NaN` shall be returned.

* If _x_ is `±0` or `±Inf`, _x_ shall be returned.
