# Synopsis 
`#include <unistd.h>`</br>

` int chdir(const char *path);`</br>

## Status
Partially implemented
## Conformance
IEEE Std 1003.1-2017
## Description


The purpose is to change working directory. The `chdir()` function shall cause the directory named by the pathname pointed to by the _path_ argument to become the
current working directory, that is, the starting point for path searches for pathnames not beginning with `'/'`.


## Return value


Upon successful completion, `0` shall be returned. Otherwise, `-1` shall be returned, the current working directory shall remain unchanged, and `errno` shall be set to indicate the error.


## Errors


The `chdir()` function shall fail if:


 * `EACCES` - Search permission is denied for any component of the pathname.

 * `ELOOP` - A loop exists in symbolic links encountered during resolution of the _path_ argument.
`ENAMETOOLONG`

The length of a component of a pathname is longer than `NAME_MAX`.

 * `ENOENT` - A component of _path_ does not name an existing directory or path is an empty string.

 * `ENOTDIR` - A component of the pathname names an existing file that is neither a directory nor a symbolic link to a directory.

The `chdir()` function may fail if:


 * `ELOOP` - More than `SYMLOOP_MAX` symbolic links were encountered during resolution of the _path_ argument.
`ENAMETOOLONG`

The length of a pathname exceeds `PATH_MAX`, or pathname resolution of a symbolic link produced an intermediate result with a
length that exceeds `PATH_MAX`.
