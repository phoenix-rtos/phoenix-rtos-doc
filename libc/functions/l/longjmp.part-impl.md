# Synopsis 
`#include <setjmp.h>`</br>

` void longjmp(jmp_buf env, int val);`</br>

## Status
Partially implemented
## Conformance
IEEE Std 1003.1-2017
## Description


 
The `longjmp()` function shall restore the environment saved by the most recent invocation of `setjmp()` in the same process, with the corresponding `jmp_buf` argument. If the most
recent invocation of `setjmp()` with the corresponding `jmp_buf` occurred in
another thread, or if there is no such invocation, or if the function containing the invocation of `setjmp()` has terminated execution in the interim, or if the invocation of `setjmp()` was within the scope of an identifier with variably modified type and execution has
left that scope in the interim, the behavior is undefined.   Â It is unspecified whether `longjmp()` restores the signal
mask, leaves the signal mask unchanged, or restores it to its value at the time `setjmp()` was called. 
All accessible objects have values, and all other components of the abstract machine have state (for example, floating-point
status flags and open files), as of the time `longjmp()` was called, except that the values of objects of automatic storage
duration are unspecified if they meet all the following conditions:



* They are local to the function containing the corresponding `setjmp()`
 invocation.





* They do not have volatile-qualified type.





* They are changed between the `setjmp()` invocation and `longjmp()` call.




Although `longjmp()` is an async-signal-safe function, if it is invoked from a signal handler which interrupted a
non-async-signal-safe function or equivalent (such as the processing equivalent to `exit()` performed after a return from the initial call to `main()`), the behavior of any
subsequent call to a non-async-signal-safe function or equivalent is undefined.

The effect of a call to `longjmp()` where initialization of the `jmp_buf` structure was not performed in the calling
thread is undefined. 


## Return value


After `longjmp()` is completed, program execution continues as if the corresponding invocation of `setjmp()` had just returned the value specified by _val_. The `longjmp()` function
shall not cause `setjmp()` to return `0`; if _val_ is `0`, `setjmp()` shall return `1`.
