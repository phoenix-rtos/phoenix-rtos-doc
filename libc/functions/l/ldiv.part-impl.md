` ldiv_t ldiv(long numer, long denom);`</br>

` lldiv_t lldiv(long long numer, long long denom);`</br>

## Status
Partially implemented
## Conformance
IEEE Std 1003.1-2017
## Description


 
These functions shall compute the quotient and remainder of the division of the numerator _numer_ by the denominator
_denom_. If the division is inexact, the resulting quotient is the long integer (for the `ldiv()` function) or
long long integer (for the `lldiv()` function) of lesser magnitude that is the nearest to the algebraic quotient. If
the result cannot be represented, the behavior is undefined; otherwise, quot * denom+rem shall equal
_numer_.


## Return value


The `ldiv()` function shall return a structure of type `ldiv_t`, comprising both the quotient and the remainder. The
structure shall include the following members, in any order:
```c
long   quot;    /* Quotient */
long   rem;     /* Remainder */
```

The `lldiv()` function shall return a structure of type `lldiv_t`, comprising both the quotient and the remainder. The
structure shall include the following members, in any order:
```c
long long   quot;    /* Quotient */
long long   rem;     /* Remainder */
```
