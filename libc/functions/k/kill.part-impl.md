## Status
Partially implemented
## Conformance
IEEE Std 1003.1-2017
## Description


The `kill()` function shall send a signal to a process or a group of processes specified by _pid_. The signal to be
sent is specified by _sig_ and is either one from the list given in `<signal.h>` or 0. If _sig_ is `0` (the `null` signal), error checking is performed but
no signal is actually sent. The `null` signal can be used to check the validity of _pid_.

For a process to have permission to send a signal to a process designated by _pid_, unless the sending process has
appropriate privileges, the real or effective user ID of the sending process shall match the real or saved set-user-ID of the
receiving process.

If _pid_ is greater than `0`, _sig_ shall be sent to the process whose process ID is equal to _pid_.

If _pid_ is `0`, _sig_ shall be sent to all processes (excluding an unspecified set of system processes) whose process
group ID is equal to the process group ID of the sender, and for which the process has permission to send a signal.

If _pid_ is `-1`, _sig_ shall be sent to all processes (excluding an unspecified set of system processes) for which the
process has permission to send that signal.

If _pid_ is negative, but not `-1`, _sig_ shall be sent to all processes (excluding an unspecified set of system
processes) whose process group ID is equal to the absolute value of _pid_, and for which the process has permission to send a
signal.

If the value of _pid_ causes _sig_ to be generated for the sending process, and if _sig_ is not blocked for the
calling thread and if no other thread has _sig_ unblocked or is waiting in a `sigwait()` function for _sig_, either _sig_ or at least one pending unblocked
signal shall be delivered to the sending thread before `kill()` returns.

The user ID tests described above shall not be applied when sending `SIGCONT` to a process that is a member of the same session as
the sending process.

An implementation that provides extended security controls may impose further implementation-defined restrictions on the sending
of signals, including the `null` signal. In particular, the system may deny the existence of some or all of the processes specified
by _pid_.

The `kill()` function is successful if the process has permission to send _sig_ to any of the processes specified by
_pid_. If `kill()` fails, no signal shall be sent.


## Return value


Upon successful completion, `0` shall be returned. Otherwise, `-1` shall be returned and errno set to indicate the error.


## Errors


The `kill()` function shall fail if:


 * `EINVAL` - The value of the _sig_ argument is an invalid or unsupported signal number.

 * `EPERM` - The process does not have permission to send the signal to any receiving process.

 * `ESRCH` - No process or process group can be found corresponding to that specified by _pid_.
