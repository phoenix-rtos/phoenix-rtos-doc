# Synopsis 
`#include <stdio.h>`</br>

` int fgetc(FILE *stream);`</br>

## Status
Partially implemented
## Conformance
IEEE Std 1003.1-2017
## Description


If the end-of-file indicator for the input stream pointed to by _stream_ is not set and a next byte is present, the
`fgetc()` function shall obtain the next byte as an unsigned char converted to an int, from the input stream
pointed to by _stream_, and advance the associated file position indicator for the stream (if defined). Since `fgetc()`
operates on bytes, reading a character consisting of multiple bytes (or "a multi-byte character") may require multiple calls to
`fgetc()`.
The
`fgetc()` function may mark the last data access timestamp of the file associated with _stream_ for update. The last data
access timestamp shall be marked for update by the first successful execution of `fgetc()`, `fgets()`, `fread()`, `fscanf()`, `getc()`, `getchar()`, `getdelim()`, `getline()`, `gets()`, or `scanf()` using _stream_ that returns data not supplied by a prior call to `ungetc()`. 


## Return value

Upon successful completion, `fgetc()` shall return the next byte from the input stream pointed to by _stream_. If the end-of-file indicator for the stream is set, or if the stream is at end-of-file, the end-of-file indicator for the stream shall be set and `fgetc()` shall return `EOF`. If a read error occurs, the error indicator for the stream shall be set, `fgetc()` shall return `EOF` and shall set `errno` to indicate the error.



## Errors


The `fgetc()` function shall fail if data needs to be read and:

 * `EAGAIN` - The `O_NONBLOCK` flag is set for the file descriptor underlying _stream_ and the thread would be delayed in the `fgetc()`
operation. 

 * `EBADF` - The file descriptor underlying _stream_ is not a valid file descriptor open for reading. 

 * `EINTR` - The read operation was terminated due to the receipt of a signal, and no data was transferred. 

 * `EIO` - A physical `I/O` error has occurred, or the process is in a background process group attempting to read from its controlling terminal,
and either the calling thread is blocking `SIGTTIN` or the process is ignoring `SIGTTIN` or the process group of the process is
orphaned. This error may also be generated for implementation-defined reasons. 

 * `EOVERFLOW` - The file is a regular file and an attempt was made to read at or beyond the offset maximum associated with the corresponding
stream. 

The `fgetc()` function may fail if:

 * `ENOMEM` - Insufficient storage space is available. 

 * `ENXIO` - A request was made of a nonexistent device, or the request was outside the capabilities of the device.
