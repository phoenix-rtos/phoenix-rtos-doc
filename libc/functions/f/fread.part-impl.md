# Synopsis 
`#include <stdio.h>`</br>

` size_t fread(void *restrict ptr, size_t size, size_t nitems, FILE *restrict stream);`</br>

## Status
Partially implemented
## Conformance
IEEE Std 1003.1-2017
## Description

The `fread()` function shall read into the array pointed to by _ptr_ up to _nitems_ elements whose size is
specified by _size_ in bytes, from the stream pointed to by _stream_. For each object, size calls shall be made to
the `fgetc()` function and the results stored, in the order read, in an array of
unsigned char exactly overlaying the object. The file position indicator for the stream (if defined) shall be advanced by
the number of bytes successfully read. If an error occurs, the resulting value of the file position indicator for the stream is
unspecified. If a partial element is read, its value is unspecified.
The
`fread()` function may mark the last data access timestamp of the file associated with _stream_ for update. The last data
access timestamp shall be marked for update by the first successful execution of `fgetc()`, `fgets()`, `fread()`, `fscanf()`, `getc()`, `getchar()`, `getdelim()`, `getline()`, `gets()`, or `scanf()` using _stream_ that returns data not supplied by a prior call to `ungetc()`. 


## Return value

Upon successful completion, `fread()` shall return the number of elements successfully read which is less than _nitems_ only if a read error or end-of-file is encountered. If _size_ or _nitems_ is `0`, `fread()` shall return `0` and the contents of the array and the state of the stream remain unchanged. Otherwise, if a read error occurs, the error indicator for the stream shall be set and `errno` shall be set to indicate the error.
