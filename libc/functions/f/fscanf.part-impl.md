## Description


The purpose is to convert formatted input. The `fscanf()` function shall read from the named input _stream_. The `scanf()` function shall read from the
standard input stream `stdin`. The `sscanf()` function shall read from the string _s_. Each function reads bytes,
interprets them according to a _format_, and stores the results in its arguments. Each expects, as arguments, a control string
format described below, and a set of pointer arguments indicating where the converted input should be stored. The
result is undefined if there are insufficient arguments for the _format_. If the format is exhausted while arguments remain, the
excess arguments shall be evaluated but otherwise ignored.
Conversions can be applied to the nth argument after the _format_ in the argument list, rather than to the next unused
argument. In this case, the conversion specifier character `%` (see below) is replaced by the sequence
`"%n$"`, where `n` is a decimal integer in the range `[1,NL_ARGMAX]`. This feature provides for the
definition of format strings that select arguments in an order appropriate to specific languages. In format strings containing the
`"%n$"` form of conversion specifications, it is unspecified whether numbered arguments in the argument list
can be referenced from the format string more than once.

The _format_ can contain either form of a conversion specification-that is, `%` or
`"%n$"`-but the two forms cannot be mixed within a single format string. The only exception to this
is that `%%` or `%*` can be mixed with the `"%n$"` form. When numbered argument specifications
are used, specifying the Nth argument requires that all the leading arguments, from the first to the `(N-1)`th, are
pointers.

The `fscanf()` function in all its forms shall allow detection of a language-dependent radix character in the input string.

The radix character is defined in the current locale (category `LC_NUMERIC)`. In the POSIX locale, or in a locale where the
radix character is not defined, the radix character shall default to a `<period> ( '.' )`. 
The _format_ is a character string, beginning and ending in its initial shift state, if any, composed of zero or more directives.

Each directive is composed of one of the following: one or more white-space characters ( `<space>`, `<tab>`,
`<newline>`, `<vertical-tab>`, or `<form-feed>`), an ordinary character (neither '`%`' nor a white-space
character), or a conversion specification. Each conversion specification is introduced by the character `'%'` or the
character sequence `"%n$"`,   after
which the following appear in sequence:



* An optional assignment-suppressing character `'*'`.

* An optional non-zero decimal integer that specifies the maximum field width.

* An optional assignment-allocation character `'m'`. 

* An option length modifier that specifies the size of the receiving object.

* A conversion specifier character that specifies the type of conversion to be applied. The valid conversion specifiers are described below.


The `fscanf()` functions shall execute each directive of the _format_ in turn. If a directive fails, as detailed below, the
function shall return. Failures are described as input failures (due to the unavailability of input bytes) or matching failures
(due to inappropriate input).

A directive composed of one or more white-space characters shall be executed by reading input until no more valid input can be
read, or up to the first byte which is not a white-space character, which remains unread.

A directive that is an ordinary character shall be executed as follows: the next byte shall be read from the input and compared
with the byte that comprises the directive, if the comparison shows that they are not equivalent, the directive shall fail, and the
differing and subsequent bytes shall remain unread. Similarly, if end-of-file, an encoding error, or a read error prevents a
character from being read, the directive shall fail.

A directive that is a conversion specification defines a set of matching input sequences, as described below for each conversion
character. A conversion specification shall be executed in the following steps.

Input white-space characters (as specified by isspace) shall be skipped, unless
the conversion specification includes a `[`, `c`, `C`, or `n` conversion specifier.

An item shall be read from the input, unless the conversion specification includes an n conversion specifier. An input
item shall be defined as the longest sequence of input bytes (up to any specified maximum field width, which may be measured in
characters or bytes dependent on the conversion specifier) which is an initial subsequence of a matching sequence. The first byte,
if any, after the input item shall remain unread. If the length of the input item is `0`, the execution of the conversion
specification shall fail; this condition is a matching failure, unless end-of-file, an encoding error, or a read error prevented
input from the _stream_, in which case it is an input failure.

Except in the case of a `%` conversion specifier, the input item (or, in the case of a `%n` conversion
specification, the count of input bytes) shall be converted to a type appropriate to the conversion character. If the input item is
not a matching sequence, the execution of the conversion specification fails; this condition is a matching failure. Unless
assignment suppression was indicated by a `'*'`, the result of the conversion shall be placed in the object pointed to by
the first argument following the _format_ argument that has not already received a conversion result if the conversion
specification is introduced by `%`, or in the nth argument if introduced by the character
sequence `"%n$"`.  If this object does not
have an appropriate type, or if the result of the conversion cannot be represented in the space provided, the behavior is
undefined.
The `%c`, `%s`, and `%[` conversion specifiers shall accept an optional assignment-allocation character
`'m'`, which shall cause a memory buffer to be allocated to hold the string converted including a terminating `null`
character. In such a case, the argument corresponding to the conversion specifier should be a reference to a pointer variable that
will receive a pointer to the allocated buffer. The system shall allocate a buffer as if `malloc()` had been called. The application shall be responsible for freeing the memory after
usage. If there is insufficient memory to allocate a buffer, the function shall set `errno` to `ENOMEM` and a conversion error
shall result. If the function returns `EOF`, any memory successfully allocated for parameters using assignment-allocation character
`'m'` by this call shall be freed before the function returns. 

The length modifiers and their meanings are:

* `hh` - Specifies that `a` following `d`, `i`, `o`, `u`, `x`, `X`, or `n`
conversion specifier applies to an argument with type pointer to `signed` `char` or `unsigned` `char`.

* `h` - Specifies that a following `d`, `i`, `o`, `u`, `x`, `X`, or `n`
conversion specifier applies to an argument with type pointer to `short` or `unsigned` `short`.

* `l (ell)` - Specifies that a following `d`, `i`, `o`, `u`, `x`, `X`, or `n`
conversion specifier applies to an argument with type pointer to `long` or `unsigned` `long`, that a following a,
`A`, `e`, `E`, `f`, `F`, `g`, or `G` conversion specifier applies to an
argument with type pointer to `double`, or that a following `c`, `s`, or `[` conversion specifier
applies to an argument with type pointer to `wchar_t`. If the `'m'` assignment-allocation character is specified,
the conversion applies to an argument with the type pointer to a pointer to `wchar_t`. 

* `ll (ell-ell)` -Specifies that a following `d`, `i`, `o`, `u`, `x`, `X`, or `n` conversion
specifier applies to an argument with type pointer to `long` `long` or `unsigned` `long` `long`.

* `j` - Specifies that a following `d`, `i`, `o`, `u`, `x`, `X`, or `n`
conversion specifier applies to an argument with type pointer to `intmax_t` or `uintmax_t`.

* `z` - Specifies that a following `d`, `i`, `o`, `u`, `x`, `X`, or `n`
conversion specifier applies to an argument with type pointer to `size_t` or the corresponding signed integer type.

* `t` - Specifies that a following `d`, `i`, `o`, `u`, x, `X`, or `n`
conversion specifier applies to an argument with type pointer to `ptrdiff_t` or the corresponding `unsigned` type.

* `L` - Specifies that a following `a`, `A`, `e`, `E`, `f`, `F`, `g`, or
`G` conversion specifier applies to an argument with type pointer to `long` `double`.

If a length modifier appears with any conversion specifier other than as specified above, the behavior is undefined.

The following conversion specifiers are valid:

* `d` - Matches an optionally signed decimal integer, whose format is the same as expected for the subject sequence of `strtol()` with the value `10` for the base argument. In the absence of a size modifier, the application shall ensure that the corresponding argument is a pointer to `int`.

* `i` - Matches an optionally signed integer, whose format is the same as expected for the subject sequence of `strtol()` with `0` for the base argument. In the absence of a size modifier, the application shall ensure that the corresponding argument is a pointer to `int`.

* `o` - Matches an optionally signed octal integer, whose format is the same as expected for the subject sequence of `strtoul()` with the value `8` for the base argument. In the absence of a size modifier,
the application shall ensure that the corresponding argument is a pointer to `unsigned`.

* `u` - Matches an optionally signed decimal integer, whose format is the same as expected for the subject sequence of `strtoul()` with the value `10` for the base argument. In the absence of a size modifier,
the application shall ensure that the corresponding argument is a pointer to `unsigned`.

* `x` - Matches an optionally signed hexadecimal integer, whose format is the same as expected for the subject sequence of `strtoul()` with the value `16` for the base argument. In the absence of a size modifier,
the application shall ensure that the corresponding argument is a pointer to `unsigned`.

* `a`, `e`, `f`, `g` - Matches an optionally signed floating-point number, infinity, or `NaN`, whose format is the same as expected for the subject sequence
of `strtod()`. In the absence of a size modifier, the application shall ensure that the
corresponding argument is a pointer to float. If the `fprintf()` family of functions generates character string representations
for infinity and `NaN` (a symbolic entity encoded in floating-point format) to support `IEEE Std 754-1985`, the `fscanf()` family of functions shall recognize them as input.

* `s` - Matches a sequence of bytes that are not white-space characters. If the `'m'` assignment-allocation character is not
specified, the application shall ensure that the corresponding argument is a pointer to the initial byte of an array of
`char`, `signed` `char`, or `unsigned` `char` large enough to accept the sequence and a terminating `null` character code,
which shall be added automatically.    Otherwise, the application shall ensure that the corresponding argument is a pointer to a
pointer to a `char`. 
If an `l (ell)` qualifier is present, the input is a sequence of characters that begins in the initial shift state. Each
character shall be converted to a wide character as if by a call to the `mbrtowc()`
function, with the conversion state described by an `mbstate_t` object initialized to zero before the first character is
converted. If the `'m'` assignment-allocation character is not specified, the application shall ensure that the
corresponding argument is a pointer to an array of `wchar_t` large enough to accept the sequence and the terminating null wide
character, which shall be added automatically. Otherwise, the application shall ensure that the corresponding
argument is a pointer to a pointer to a `wchar_t`. 

* `[` - Matches a non-empty sequence of bytes from a set of expected bytes (the scanset). The normal skip over white-space
characters shall be suppressed in this case. If the `'m'` assignment-allocation character is not specified, the application
shall ensure that the corresponding argument is a pointer to the initial byte of an array of `char`, `signed` `char`, or
`unsigned` `char` large enough to accept the sequence and a terminating `null` byte, which shall be added automatically.  
Otherwise, the application shall ensure that the corresponding argument is a pointer to a pointer to a `char`. 
If an `l (ell)` qualifier is present, the input is a sequence of characters that begins in the initial shift state. Each
character in the sequence shall be converted to a wide character as if by a call to the `mbrtowc()` function, with the conversion state described by an `mbstate_t` object
initialized to zero before the first character is converted. If the `'m'` assignment-allocation character is not specified,
the application shall ensure that the corresponding argument is a pointer to an array of `wchar_t` large enough to accept the
sequence and the terminating `null` wide character, which shall be added automatically.
Otherwise, the application shall ensure that the corresponding argument is a pointer to a pointer to a `wchar_t`. 
The conversion specification includes all subsequent bytes in the format string up to and including the matching
`<right-square-bracket>` `( ']' )`. The bytes between the square brackets (the scanlist) comprise the scanset,
unless the byte after the `<left-square-bracket>` is a `<circumflex>` `( '^' )`, in which case the scanset contains
all bytes that do not appear in the scanlist between the `<circumflex>` and the `<right-square-bracket>`. If the conversion
specification begins with `"[]"` or `"[^]"`, the `<right-square-bracket>` is included in the scanlist and the
next `<right-square-bracket>` is the matching `<right-square-bracket>` that ends the conversion specification; otherwise,
the first `<right-square-bracket>` is the one that ends the conversion specification. If a `'-'` is in the scanlist and
is not the first character, nor the second where the first character is a `'^'`, nor the last character, the behavior is
implementation-defined.

* `c` - Matches a sequence of bytes of the number specified by the field width (`1` if no field width is present in the conversion
specification). No `null` byte is added. The normal skip over white-space characters shall be suppressed in this case. If the
`'m'` assignment-allocation character is not specified, the application shall ensure that the corresponding argument is a
pointer to the initial byte of an array of `char`, `signed` `char`, or `unsigned` `char` large enough to accept the
sequence.    Otherwise, the application shall ensure that the corresponding argument is a pointer to a pointer to a `char`. 
If an `l (ell)` qualifier is present, the input shall be a sequence of characters that begins in the initial shift state. Each character in the sequence is converted to a wide character as if by a call to the `mbrtowc()` function, with the conversion state described by an `mbstate_t` object
initialized to zero before the first character is converted. No `null` wide character is added. If the `'m'`
assignment-allocation character is not specified, the application shall ensure that the corresponding argument is a pointer to an
array of `wchar_t` large enough to accept the resulting sequence of wide characters.    Otherwise, the
application shall ensure that the corresponding argument is a pointer to a pointer to a `wchar_t`. 

* `p` - Matches an implementation-defined set of sequences, which shall be the same as the set of sequences that is produced by the
`%p` conversion specification of the corresponding `fprintf()` functions. The
application shall ensure that the corresponding argument is a pointer to a pointer to void. The interpretation of the input
item is implementation-defined. If the input item is a value converted earlier during the same program execution, the pointer that
results shall compare equal to that value; otherwise, the behavior of the %p conversion specification is undefined.
* `n` - No input is consumed. The application shall ensure that the corresponding argument is a pointer to the integer into which shall
be written the number of bytes read from the input so far by this call to the `fscanf()` functions. Execution of a `%n`
conversion specification shall not increment the assignment count returned at the completion of execution of the function. No
argument shall be converted, but one shall be consumed. If the conversion specification includes an assignment-suppressing
character or a field width, the behavior is undefined.

* `C` - Equivalent to `lc`. 

* `S` - Equivalent to `ls`. 

* `%` - Matches a single `'%'` character; no conversion or assignment occurs. The complete conversion specification shall be `%%`.

If a conversion specification is invalid, the behavior is undefined.

The conversion specifiers `A`, `E`, `F`, `G`, and `X` are also valid and shall be
equivalent to `a`, `e`, `f`, `g`, and `x`, respectively.

If end-of-file is encountered during input, conversion shall be terminated. If end-of-file occurs before any bytes matching the
current conversion specification (except for `%n` ) have been read (other than leading white-space characters, where
permitted), execution of the current conversion specification shall terminate with an input failure. Otherwise, unless execution of
the current conversion specification is terminated with a matching failure, execution of the following conversion specification (if
any) shall be terminated with an input failure.

Reaching the end of the string in `sscanf()` shall be equivalent to encountering end-of-file for `fscanf()`.

If conversion terminates on a conflicting input, the offending input is left unread in the input. Any trailing white space
(including `<newline>` characters) shall be left unread unless matched by a conversion specification. The success of literal
matches and suppressed assignments is only directly determinable via the `%n` conversion specification.
The
`fscanf()` and `scanf()` functions may mark the last data access timestamp of the file associated with _stream_ for
update. The last data access timestamp shall be marked for update by the first successful execution of `fgetc()`, `fgets()`, `fread()`, `getc()`, `getchar()`, `getdelim()`, `getline()`, `gets()`, `fscanf()`, or
`scanf()` using _stream_ that returns data not supplied by a prior call to `ungetc()`. 


## Return value

Upon successful completion, these functions shall return the number of successfully matched and assigned input items, this number can be zero in the event of an early matching failure. If the input ends before the first conversion (if any) has completed, and without a matching failure having occurred, `EOF` shall be returned. If an error occurs before the first conversion (if any) has completed, and without a matching failure having occurred, `EOF` shall be returned and `errno` shall be set to indicate the error. If a read error occurs, the error indicator for the stream shall be set.


## Errors


For the conditions under which the `fscanf()` functions fail and may fail, refer to `fgetc` or `fgetwc`.

In addition, the `fscanf()` function shall fail if:


 * `EILSEQ` - Input byte sequence does not form a valid character. 

 * `ENOMEM` - Insufficient storage space is available.

In addition, the `fscanf()` function may fail if:

 - `EINVAL` - There are insufficient arguments.
