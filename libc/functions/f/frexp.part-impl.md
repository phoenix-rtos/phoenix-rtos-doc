` double frexp(double num, int *exp);`</br>

` float frexpf(float num, int *exp);`</br>

## Status
Partially implemented
## Conformance
IEEE Std 1003.1-2017
## Description


The purpose is to extract mantissa and exponent from a double precision number. These functions shall break a floating-point number _num_ into a normalized fraction and an integral power of 2. The
integer exponent shall be stored in the int object pointed to by _exp_.


## Return value


For finite arguments, these functions shall return the value `x`, such that `x` has a magnitude in the interval `[½,1)` or `0`, and _num_ equals `x` times `2` raised to the power _*exp_.

If _num_ is `NaN`, a `NaN` shall be returned, and the value of _*exp_ is unspecified.

If _num_ is `±0`, `±0` shall be returned, and the value of _*exp_ shall be `0`.

If _num_ is `±Inf`, _num_ shall be returned, and the value of _*exp_ is unspecified.
