# Synopsis 
`#include <stdio.h>`</br>

` size_t fwrite(const void *restrict ptr, size_t size, size_t nitems,`</br>
`        FILE *restrict stream);`</br>

## Status
Partially implemented
## Conformance
IEEE Std 1003.1-2017
## Description


The `fwrite()` function shall write, from the array pointed to by _ptr_, up to _nitems_ elements whose size is
specified by _size_, to the stream pointed to by _stream_. For each object, size calls shall be made to the `fputc()` function, taking the values (in order) from an array of unsigned char
exactly overlaying the object. The file-position indicator for the stream (if defined) shall be advanced by the number of bytes
successfully written. If an error occurs, the resulting value of the file-position indicator for the stream is unspecified.
The
last data modification and last file status change timestamps of the file shall be marked for update between the successful
execution of `fwrite()` and the next successful completion of a call to `fflush()`
or `fclose()` on the same stream, or a call to `exit()` or `abort()`. 


## Return value


The `fwrite()` function shall return the number of elements successfully written, which may be less than _nitems_ if a write error is encountered. If _size_ or _nitems_ is `0`, `fwrite()` shall return `0` and the state of the stream remains unchanged. Otherwise, if a write error occurs, the error indicator for the stream shall be set, and `errno` shall be set to indicate the error.


## Errors


Refer to fputc.
