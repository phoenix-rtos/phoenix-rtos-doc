## Status

## Description


The purpose is to reposition a file-position indicator in a stream. The `fseek()` function shall set the file-position indicator for the stream pointed to by _stream_. If a read or write
error occurs, the error indicator for the stream shall be set and `fseek()` fails.

The new position, measured in bytes from the beginning of the file, shall be obtained by adding _offset_ to the position
specified by _whence_. The specified point is the beginning of the file for `SEEK_SET,` the current value of the file-position
indicator for `SEEK_CUR,` or end-of-file for `SEEK_END`.

If the stream is to be used with wide-character input/output functions, the application shall ensure that _offset_ is
either `0` or a value returned by an earlier call to `ftell()` on the same stream and
_whence_ is `SEEK_SET`.

A successful call to `fseek()` shall clear the end-of-file indicator for the stream and undo any effects of `ungetc()` and `ungetwc()` on the same stream.

After an `fseek()` call, the next operation on an update stream may be either input or output.
If the most recent operation, other than `ftell()`, on a given stream is `fflush()`, the file offset in the underlying open file description shall be adjusted to
reflect the location specified by `fseek()`.

The `fseek()` function shall allow the file-position indicator to be set beyond the end of existing data in the file. If
data is later written at this point, subsequent reads of data in the gap shall return bytes with the value `0` until data is actually
written into the gap.

The behavior of `fseek()` on devices which are incapable of seeking is implementation-defined. The value of the file offset
associated with such a device is undefined.

If the stream is writable and buffered data had not been written to the underlying file, `fseek()` shall cause the
unwritten data to be written to the file and shall mark the last data modification and last file status change timestamps of the
file for update.

In a locale with state-dependent encoding, whether `fseek()` restores the stream's shift state is
implementation-defined.

The `fseeko()` function shall be equivalent to the `fseek()` function except that the _offset_ argument is of
type `off_t`. 


## Return value


The `fseek()` and `fseeko()` functions shall return `0` if they succeed.

Otherwise, they shall return `-1` and set `errno` to indicate the error.


## Errors


The `fseek()`    and `fseeko()` 
 functions shall fail if, either the stream is unbuffered or the stream's buffer needed to be flushed, and
the call to `fseek()` or `fseeko()` causes an underlying `lseek()` or `write()` to be invoked, and: 


 * `EAGAIN` - The `O_NONBLOCK` flag is set for the file descriptor and the thread would be delayed in the write operation. 

 * `EBADF` - The file descriptor underlying the stream file is not open for writing or the stream's buffer needed to be flushed and the file is
not open. 

 * `EFBIG` - An attempt was made to write a file that exceeds the maximum file size. 

 * `EFBIG` - An attempt was made to write a file that exceeds the file size limit of the process. 

 * `EFBIG` - The file is a regular file and an attempt was made to write at or beyond the offset maximum associated with the corresponding
stream. 

 * `EINTR` - The write operation was terminated due to the receipt of a signal, and no data was transferred. 

 * `EINVAL` - The _whence_ argument is invalid. The resulting file-position indicator would be set to a negative value. 

 * `EIO` - A physical I/O error has occurred, or the process is a member of a background process group attempting to perform a `write()` to its controlling terminal, `TOSTOP` is set, the calling thread is not blocking
`SIGTTOU`, the process is not ignoring `SIGTTOU`, and the process group of the process is orphaned. This error may also be returned
under implementation-defined conditions. 

 * `ENOSPC` - There was no free space remaining on the device containing the file. 

 * `EOVERFLOW` - For `fseek()`, the resulting file offset would be a value which cannot be represented correctly in an object of type
`long`. 

 * `EOVERFLOW` - For `fseeko()`, the resulting file offset would be a value which cannot be represented correctly in an object of type
`off_t`. 

 * `EPIPE` - An attempt was made to write to a pipe or FIFO that is not open for reading by any process; a `SIGPIPE` signal shall also be sent to the
thread. 

 * `ESPIPE` - The file descriptor underlying stream is associated with a pipe, FIFO, or socket. 

The `fseek()` and `fseeko()` 
 functions may fail if:

 * `ENXIO` - A request was made of a nonexistent device, or the request was outside the capabilities of the device.
