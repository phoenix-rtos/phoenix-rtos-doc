# Synopsis 
`#include <stdio.h>`</br>

` long ftell(FILE *stream);`</br>

`off_t ftello(FILE *stream); `</br>

## Status
Partially implemented
## Conformance
IEEE Std 1003.1-2017
## Description


The purpose is to return a file offset in a stream. The `ftell()` function shall obtain the current value of the file-position indicator for the stream pointed to by
_stream_.

The `ftell()` function shall not change the setting of errno if successful.
The `ftello()` function shall be equivalent to `ftell()`, except that the return value is of type `off_t` and the `ftello()` function may change the setting of `errno` if successful. 


## Return value


Upon successful completion, `ftell()` and `ftello()` shall return the current value of the file-position indicator for the stream measured in bytes from the beginning of the file.

Otherwise, `ftell()` and `ftello()` shall return `-1`, and set `errno` to indicate the error.


## Errors


The `ftell()`   Â and `ftello()`  functions
shall fail if:


 * `EBADF` - The file descriptor underlying stream is not an open file descriptor. 

 * `EOVERFLOW` - For `ftell()`, the current file offset cannot be represented correctly in an object of type long. 

 * `EOVERFLOW` - For `ftello()`, the current file offset cannot be represented correctly in an object of type `off_t`.

 * `ESPIPE` - The file descriptor underlying stream is associated with a pipe, FIFO, or socket.
