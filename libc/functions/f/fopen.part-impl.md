## Description

The `fopen()` function shall open the file whose pathname is the string pointed to by _pathname_, and associates a
stream with it.

The mode argument points to a string. If the string is one of the following, the file shall be opened in the indicated
mode. Otherwise, the behavior is undefined.

* `r` or `rb` - Open file for reading.
* `w` or `wb` - Truncate to zero length or create file for writing.
* `a` or `ab` - Append; open or create file for writing at end-of-file.
* `r+` or `rb+` or `r+b` - Open file for update (reading and writing).
* `w+` or `wb+` or `w+b` - Truncate to zero length or create file for update.
* `a+` or `ab+` or `a+b` - Append; open or create file for update, writing at end-of-file.

The
character `'b'` shall have no effect, but is allowed for `ISO C` standard conformance.  Opening a file with read mode (`r` as the first character in the mode argument) shall
fail if the file does not exist or cannot be read.

Opening a file with append mode (`a` as the first character in the mode argument) shall cause all subsequent writes
to the file to be forced to the then current end-of-file, regardless of intervening calls to `fseek()`.

When a file is opened with update mode ( `'+'` as the second or third character in the mode argument), both input
and output may be performed on the associated stream. However, the application shall ensure that output is not directly followed by
input without an intervening call to `fflush()` or to a file positioning function (`fseek()`, `fsetpos()`, or `rewind()`), and input is not directly followed by output without an intervening call to a file
positioning function, unless the input operation encounters end-of-file.

When opened, a stream is fully buffered if and only if it can be determined not to refer to an interactive device. The error and
end-of-file indicators for the stream shall be cleared.
If
mode is `w`, `wb`, `a`, `ab`, `w+`, `wb+`, `w+b`, `a+`, `ab+`, or
`a+b`, and the file did not previously exist, upon successful completion, `fopen()` shall mark for update the last
data access, last data modification, and last file status change timestamps of the file and the last file status change and last
data modification timestamps of the parent directory.

If mode is `w`, `wb`, `a`, `ab`, `w+`, `wb+`, `w+b`, `a+`, `ab+`, or
`a+b`, and the file did not previously exist, the `fopen()` function shall create a file as if it called the `creat()` function with a value appropriate for the path argument interpreted from
_pathname_ and a value of `S_IRUSR` | `S_IWUSR` | `S_IRGRP` | `S_IWGRP` | `S_IROTH` | `S_IWOTH` for the mode argument.

If mode is `w`, `wb`, `w+`, `wb+`, or `w+b`, and the file did previously exist, upon
successful completion, `fopen()` shall mark for update the last data modification and last file status change timestamps of
the file. 
After a successful call to the `fopen()` function, the orientation of the stream shall be cleared, the encoding
rule shall be cleared,  and the associated `mbstate_t` object
shall be set to describe an initial conversion state.
The
file descriptor associated with the opened stream shall be allocated and opened as if by a call to `open()` with the following flags:

| `fopen()` Mode         | `open()` Flags                        |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| `r` or `rb`            | `O_RDONLY`                            |
| `w` or `wb`            | `O_WRONLY ׀ O_CREAT ׀ O_TRUNC`        |
| `a` or `ab`            | `O_WRONLY ׀ O_CREAT ׀ O_APPEND`       |
| `r+` or `rb+` or `r+b` | `O_RDWR`                              |
| `w+` or `wb+` or `w+b` | `O_RDWR ׀ O_CREAT ׀ O_TRUNC`          |
| `a+` or `ab+` or `a+b` | `O_RDWR ׀ O_CREAT ׀ O_APPEND`         |


## Return value

Upon successful completion, `fopen()` shall return a pointer to the object controlling the stream. Otherwise, a `null` pointer shall be returned and `errno` shall be set to indicate the error.

## Errors


The `fopen()` function shall fail if:


 * `EACCES` - Search permission is denied on a component of the path prefix, or the file exists and the permissions specified by mode are
denied, or the file does not exist and write permission is denied for the parent directory of the file to be created. 

 * `EINTR` - A signal was caught during `fopen()`. 

 * `EISDIR` - The named file is a directory and mode requires write access. 

 * `ELOOP` - A loop exists in symbolic links encountered during resolution of the path argument. 

 * `EMFILE` - All file descriptors available to the process are currently open. 

 * `EMFILE` - `STREAM_MAX` streams are currently open in the calling process. 

 * `ENAMETOOLONG` - The length of a _pathname_ exceeds `PATH_MAX`, or _pathname_ resolution of a symbolic link produced an intermediate result with a
length that exceeds `PATH_MAX`. 

 * `ENFILE` - The maximum allowable number of files is currently open in the system. 

 * `ENOENT` - The mode string begins with `'r'` and a component of _pathname_ does not name an existing file, or mode
begins with `'w'` or `'a'` and a component of the path prefix of _pathname_ does not name an existing file, or
_pathname_ is an empty string. 
`ENOENT` or `ENOTDIR`
 
The pathname argument contains at least one non- <slash> character and ends with one or more trailing <slash>
characters. If pathname without the trailing <slash> characters would name an existing file, an `ENOENT` error shall
not occur. 

 * `ENOSPC` - The directory or file system that would contain the new file cannot be expanded, the file does not exist, and the file was to be
created. 

 * `ENOTDIR` - A component of the path prefix names an existing file that is neither a directory nor a symbolic link to a directory, or the
pathname argument contains at least one non- <slash> character and ends with one or more trailing <slash>
characters and the last pathname component names an existing file that is neither a directory nor a symbolic link to a directory.


 * `ENXIO` - The named file is a character special or block special file, and the device associated with this special file does not exist. 

 * `EOVERFLOW` - The named file is a regular file and the size of the file cannot be represented correctly in an object of type `off_t`. 

 * `EROFS` - The named file resides on a read-only file system and mode requires write access. 

The `fopen()` function may fail if:

 * `EINVAL` - The value of the mode argument is not valid. 

 * `ELOOP` - More than `SYMLOOP_MAX` symbolic links were encountered during resolution of the path argument. 

 * `EMFILE` - `FOPEN_MAX` streams are currently open in the calling process. 

 * `ENAMETOOLONG` - The length of a component of a pathname is longer than `NAME_MAX`. 

 * `ENOMEM` - Insufficient storage space is available. 

 * `ETXTBSY` - The file is a pure procedure (shared text) file that is being executed and mode requires write access.
