# Synopsis 
`#include <unistd.h>`

` int fchown(int fildes, uid_t owner, gid_t group);`


## Status
Declared, not implemented
## Conformance
IEEE Std 1003.1-2017
## Description


The `fchown()` function shall be equivalent to `chown()` except that the file
whose _owner_ and _group_ are changed is specified by the file descriptor _fildes_.


## Return value


Upon successful completion, `fchown()` shall return 0. Otherwise, it shall return -1 and set `errno` to indicate the
error.


## Errors


The `fchown()` function shall fail if:


 * `EBADF` - The _fildes_ argument is not an open file descriptor.

 * `EPERM` - The effective user ID does not match the owner of the file or the process does not have appropriate privileges and
`_POSIX_CHOWN_RESTRICTED` indicates that such privilege is required.

 * `EROFS` - The file referred to by _fildes_ resides on a read-only file system.

The `fchown()` function may fail if:


 * `EINVAL` - The owner or group ID is not a value supported by the implementation. The _fildes_ argument refers to a pipe or socket or an `fattach()`-ed STREAM  and the implementation disallows execution of `fchown()` on a pipe.

 * `EIO` - A physical I/O error has occurred.

 * `EINTR` - The `fchown()` function was interrupted by a signal which was caught.
