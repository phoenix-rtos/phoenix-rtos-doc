# Synopsis 
`#include <unistd.h>`</br>

` int fsync(int fildes); `</br>


## Status
Declared, not implemented
## Conformance
IEEE Std 1003.1-2017
## Description


The `fsync()` function shall request that all data for the open file descriptor named by _fildes_ is to be transferred
to the storage device associated with the file described by _fildes_. The nature of the transfer is implementation-defined.

The `fsync()` function shall not return until the system has completed that action or until an error is detected.

If `_POSIX_SYNCHRONIZED_IO` is defined, the `fsync()` function shall force all currently queued I/O operations associated with
the file indicated by file descriptor _fildes_ to the synchronized I/O completion state. All I/O operations shall be completed
as defined for synchronized I/O file integrity completion.


## Return value


Upon successful completion, `fsync()` shall return `0`. Otherwise, `-1` shall be returned and `errno` set to indicate the error. If the `fsync()` function fails, outstanding I/O operations are not guaranteed to have been completed.


## Errors


The `fsync()` function shall fail if:


 * `EBADF` - The _fildes_ argument is not a valid descriptor.

 * `EINTR` - The `fsync()` function was interrupted by a signal.

 * `EINVAL` - The _fildes_ argument does not refer to a file on which this operation is possible.

 * `EIO` - An I/O error occurred while reading from or writing to the file system.

In the event that any of the queued I/O operations fail, `fsync()` shall return the error conditions defined for `read()` and `write()`.

## Tests
