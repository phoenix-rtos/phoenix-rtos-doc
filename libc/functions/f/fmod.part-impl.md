## Status
Partially implemented
## Conformance
IEEE Std 1003.1-2017
## Description


These functions shall return the floating-point remainder of the division of _x_ by _y_.

An application wishing to check for error situations should set `errno` to zero and call
`feclearexcept(FE_ALL_EXCEPT)` before calling these functions. On return, if `errno` is non-zero or
`fetestexcept(FE_INVALID | FE_DIVBYZERO | FE_OVERFLOW | FE_UNDERFLOW)` is non-zero, an error has occurred.


## Return value


These functions shall return the value `(x-i*y)`, for some integer `i` such that, if _y_ is non-zero, the result has the same sign as _x_ and magnitude less than the magnitude of _y_.

If the correct value would cause underflow and is not representable,a range error may occur, and `fmod()`, `modf()`, and `fmodl()` shall return `0.0`, or (if the `IEC 60559` Floating-Point option is not supported) an implementation-defined value no greater in magnitude than `DBL_MIN`, `FLT_MIN`, and `LDBL_MIN`, respectively.

If _x_ or _y_ is `NaN`, a `NaN` shall be returned, and none of the conditions below shall be considered.

If _y_ is zero, a domain error shall occur, and a `NaN` shall be returned.

If _x_ is infinite, a domain error shall occur, and a `NaN` shall be returned.

If _x_ is `±0` and _y_ is not zero, `±0` shall be returned.

If _x_ is not infinite and _y_ is `±Inf`, _x_ shall be returned.

If the correct value would cause underflow, and is representable, a range error may occur and the correct value shall be returned.


## Errors


These functions shall fail if:

 * `Domain Error` - The _x_ argument is infinite or _y_ is zero. </br>
 If the integer expression `(math_errhandling & MATH_ERRNO)` is non-zero, then `errno` shall be set to `EDOM`. If
the integer expression `(math_errhandling & MATH_ERREXCEPT)` is non-zero, then the invalid floating-point exception shall
be raised.


These functions may fail if:

 * `Range Error` - The result underflows. </br>
 If the integer expression `(math_errhandling & MATH_ERRNO)` is non-zero, then `errno` shall be set to `ERANGE`. If
the integer expression `(math_errhandling & MATH_ERREXCEPT)` is non-zero, then the underflow floating-point exception
shall be raised.
