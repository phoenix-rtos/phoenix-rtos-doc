# Synopsis 
`#include <unistd.h>`

` int fchdir(int fildes);`

## Status
Declared, not implemented
## Conformance
IEEE Std 1003.1-2017
## Description


The `fchdir()` function shall be equivalent to `chdir()` except that the directory that is to be the new current working directory is specified by the file descriptor _fildes_.

A conforming application can obtain a file descriptor for a file of type directory using `open()`, provided that the file status flags and access modes do not contain `O_WRONLY` or
`O_RDWR`.


## Return value


Upon successful completion, `fchdir()` shall return 0. Otherwise, it shall return -1 and set `errno` to indicate the
error. On failure the current working directory shall remain unchanged.


## Errors


The `fchdir()` function shall fail if:


 * `EACCES` - Search permission is denied for the directory referenced by _fildes_.

 * `EBADF` - The _fildes_ argument is not an open file descriptor.

 * `ENOTDIR` - The open file descriptor _fildes_ does not refer to a directory.

The `fchdir()` may fail if:


 * `EINTR` - A signal was caught during the execution of `fchdir()`.

 * `EIO` - An I/O error occurred while reading from or writing to the file system.
