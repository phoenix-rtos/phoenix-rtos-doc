# Synopsis 
`#include <stdio.h>`</br>

` char *fgets(char *restrict s, int n, FILE *restrict stream);`</br>

## Status
Partially implemented
## Conformance
IEEE Std 1003.1-2017
## Description


The `fgets()` function shall read bytes from _stream_ into the array pointed to by _s_ until `n-1` bytes are
read, or a `<newline>` is read and transferred to _s_, or an end-of-file condition is encountered. A `null` byte shall be
written immediately after the last byte read into the array. If the end-of-file condition is encountered before any bytes are read,
the contents of the array pointed to by _s_ shall not be changed.
The
`fgets()` function may mark the last data access timestamp of the file associated with _stream_ for update. The last data
access timestamp shall be marked for update by the first successful execution of `fgetc()`, `fgets()`, `fread()`, `fscanf()`, `getc()`, `getchar()`, `getdelim()`, `getline()`, `gets()`, or `scanf()` using _stream_ that returns data not supplied by a prior call to `ungetc()`. 


## Return value


Upon successful completion, fgets() shall return _s_. If the stream is at end-of-file, the end-of-file indicator for the stream shall be set and `fgets()` shall return a `null` pointer. If a read error occurs, the error indicator for the stream shall be set, `fgets()` shall return a `null` pointer and shall set `errno` to indicate the error.
