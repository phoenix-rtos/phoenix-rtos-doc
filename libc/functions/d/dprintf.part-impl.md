## Description

The functions print formatted output.

Arguments:

* _fildes_ - the file descriptor,
* _format_ - a character string defining output format.
* _s_ - a character table, to which the resulting formatted string will be put,
* _n_ - the size of the buffer,

The `fprintf()` function places output on the named output stream. The `printf()` function places output on the standard
output stream `stdout`. The `sprintf()` function places output followed by the null byte, '\0', in consecutive bytes
starting at *s; it is the user's responsibility to ensure that enough space is available.

The `dprintf()` function is equivalent to the `fprintf()` function, except that `dprintf()` writes output to the file
associated with the file descriptor specified by the _fildes_ argument rather than place output on a stream.

The `snprintf()` function is equivalent to `sprintf()`, with the addition of the _n_ argument which states the size
of the buffer referred to by _s_. If _n_ is zero, nothing is written and _s_ may be a null pointer.
Otherwise, output bytes beyond the _n_-1st are discarded instead of being written to the array, and a null byte is
written at the end of the bytes actually written into the array.

If copying takes place between objects that overlap as a result of a call to `sprintf()` or `snprintf()`,
the results are undefined.

Each of these functions converts, formats, and prints its arguments under control of the _format_.
The _format_ is a character string, beginning and ending in its initial shift state, if any. The _format_ is
composed of zero or more directives: ordinary characters, which are simply copied to the output stream, and conversion
specifications, each of which results in the fetching of zero or more arguments. The results are undefined if there are
insufficient arguments for the _format_. If the _format_ is exhausted while arguments remain, the excess
arguments are evaluated but are otherwise ignored.

Conversions can be applied to the nth argument after the format in the argument list, rather than to the next unused
argument. In this case, the conversion specifier character `%` (see below) is replaced by the sequence `"%n$"`, where
`n` is a decimal integer in the range `[1,{NL_ARGMAX}]`, giving the position of the argument in the argument list. This
feature provides for the definition of format strings that select arguments in an order appropriate to specific
languages.

The format can contain either numbered argument conversion specifications (that is, `"%n$"` and `"*m$"`), or unnumbered
argument conversion specifications (that is, `%` and `*`), but not both. The only exception to this is that `%%` can be
mixed with the `"%n$"` form. The results of mixing numbered and unnumbered argument specifications in a format string
are undefined. When numbered argument specifications are used, specifying the Nth argument requires that all the leading
arguments, from the first to the `(N-1)`th, are specified in the format string.

In format strings containing the `"%n$"` form of conversion specification, numbered arguments in the argument list can
be referenced from the format string as many times as required.

In format strings containing the `%` form of conversion specification, each conversion specification uses the first
unused argument in the argument list.

All forms of the `fprintf()` functions allow for the insertion of a language-dependent radix character in the output
string. The radix character is defined in the current locale (category `LC_NUMERIC`). In the POSIX locale, or in a
locale where the radix character is not defined, the radix character defaults to a (`'.'`).

Each conversion specification is introduced by the `'%'` character or by the character sequence `"%n$"`, after which the
following appear in sequence:

* Zero or more flags (in any order), which modify the meaning of the conversion specification.

* An optional minimum field width. If the converted value has fewer bytes than the field width, it is padded with
characters by default on the left; it shall be padded on the right if the left-adjustment flag (`'-'`), described
below, is given to the field width. The field width takes the form of a (`'*'`), described below, or a decimal
integer.

* An optional precision that gives the minimum number of digits to appear for the `d`, `i`, `o`, `u`, `x`, and `X`
conversion specifiers; the number of digits to appear after the radix character for the `a`, `A`, `e`, `E`, `f`, and `F`
conversion specifiers; the maximum number of significant digits for the `g` and `G` conversion specifiers; or the
maximum number of bytes to be printed from a string in the `s` and `S` conversion specifiers. The precision takes the
form of a (`'.'`) followed either by a (`'*'`), described below, or an optional decimal digit string, where a null
digit string is treated as zero. If a precision appears with any other conversion specifier, the behavior is undefined.

* An optional length modifier that specifies the size of the argument.

* A conversion specifier character that indicates the type of conversion to be applied.

A field width, or precision, or both, may be indicated by a (`'*'`). In this case, an argument of type
`int` supplies the field width or precision. Applications ensure that arguments specifying field width, or precision,
or both appear in that order before the argument, if any, to be converted. A negative field width is taken as a `'-'`
flag followed by a positive field width. A negative precision is taken as if the precision were omitted. In format
strings containing the `"%n$"` form of a conversion specification, a field width or precision may be indicated by the
sequence `"*m$"`, where `m` is a decimal integer in the range `[1,{NL_ARGMAX}]` giving the position in the argument list
(after the format argument) of an integer argument containing the field width or precision, for example:

`printf("%1$d:%2$.*3$d:%4$.*3$d\n", hour, min, precision, sec);`

The flag characters and their meanings are:

* `'` (The apostrophe) The integer portion of the result of a decimal conversion (`%i`, `%d`, `%u`, `%f`, `%F`, `%g`,
or `%G`) are formatted with thousands' grouping characters. For other conversions the behavior is undefined. The
non-monetary grouping character is used.

* `-` The result of the conversion is left-justified within the field. The conversion is right-justified if this flag is
not specified.

* `+` The result of a signed conversion always begins with a sign (`'+'` or `'-'`). The conversion begins with a sign
only when a negative value is converted if this flag is not specified.

* `'space'` If the first character of a signed conversion is not a sign or if a signed conversion results in no
characters, a `'space'` is prefixed to the result. This means that if the `'space'` and `'+'` flags both appear, the
`'space'` flag are ignored.

* `#` Specifies that the value is to be converted to an alternative form. For `o` conversion, it increases the
precision, if and only if necessary, to force the first digit of the result to be a zero (if the value and precision are
both `0`, a single `0` is printed). For `x` or `X` conversion specifiers, a non-zero result has `0x` (or `0X`) prefixed
to it. For `a`, `A`, `e`, `E`, `f`, `F`, `g`, and `G` conversion specifiers, the result always contains a radix
character, even if no digits follow the radix character. Without this flag, a radix character appears in the result of
these conversions only if a digit follows it. For `g` and `G` conversion specifiers, trailing zeros are not removed
from the result as they normally are. For other conversion specifiers, the behavior is undefined.

* `0` For `d`, `i`, `o`, `u`, `x`, `X`, `a`, `A`, `e`, `E`, `f`, `F`, `g`, and `G` conversion specifiers, leading zeros
(following any indication of sign or base) are used to pad to the field width rather than performing space padding,
except when converting an infinity or `NaN`. If the `'0'` and `'-'` flags both appear, the `'0'` flag is ignored. For
`d`, `i`, `o`, `u`, `x`, and `X` conversion specifiers, if a precision is specified, the `'0'` flag is ignored. If the
`'0'` and `'` flags both appear, the grouping characters are inserted before zero padding. For other
conversions, the behavior is undefined.

The length modifiers and their meanings are:

* `hh` Specifies that a following `d`, `i`, `o`, `u`, `x`, or `X` conversion specifier applies to a `signed char` or
`unsigned char` argument (the argument will have been promoted according to the integer promotions, but its value is
converted to `signed char` or `unsigned char` before printing); or that a following `n` conversion specifier applies to
a pointer to a `signed char` argument.

* `h` Specifies that a following `d`, `i`, `o`, `u`, `x`, or `X` conversion specifier applies to a `short` or
`unsigned short` argument (the argument will have been promoted according to the integer promotions, but its value is
converted to `short` or `unsigned short` before printing); or that a following `n` conversion specifier applies to a
pointer to a `short` argument.

* `l` (`ell`) Specifies that a following `d`, `i`, `o`, `u`, `x`, or `X` conversion specifier applies to a `long` or
`unsigned long` argument; that a following `n` conversion specifier applies to a pointer to a `long` argument; that a
following `c` conversion specifier applies to a `wint_t` argument; that a following s conversion specifier applies to a
pointer to a `wchar_t` argument; or has no effect on a following `a`, `A`, `e`, `E`, `f`, `F`, `g`, or `G`
conversion specifier.

* `ll` (`ell`-`ell`) Specifies that a following `d`, `i`, `o`, `u`, `x`, or `X` conversion specifier applies to a `long
long` or `unsigned long long` argument; or that a following `n` conversion specifier applies to a pointer to a
`long long` argument.

* `j` Specifies that a following `d`, `i`, `o`, `u`, `x`, or `X` conversion specifier applies to a `intmax_t` or
`uintmax_t` argument; or that a following `n` conversion specifier applies to a pointer to a `intmax_t` argument.

* `z` Specifies that a following `d`, `i`, `o`, `u`, `x`, or `X` conversion specifier applies to a `size_t` or the
corresponding `signed integer` type argument; or that a following `n` conversion specifier applies to a pointer to a
`signed integer` type corresponding to a `size_t` argument.

* `t` Specifies that a following `d`, `i`, `o`, `u`, `x`, or `X` conversion specifier applies to a `ptrdiff_t` or the
corresponding `unsigned` type argument; or that a following `n` conversion specifier applies to a pointer to a
`ptrdiff_t` argument.

* `L` Specifies that a following `a`, `A`, `e`, `E`, `f`, `F`, `g`, or `G` conversion specifier applies to a
`long double` argument.

If a length modifier appears with any conversion specifier other than as specified above, the behavior is undefined.

The conversion specifiers and their meanings are:

* `d`, `i` The `int` argument is converted to a `signed` decimal in the style `"[-]dddd"`. The precision specifies the
minimum number of digits to appear; if the value being converted can be represented in fewer digits, it is expanded with
leading zeros. The default precision is `1`. The result of converting zero with an explicit precision of zero is no
characters.

* `o` The `unsigned` argument is converted to `unsigned` octal format in the style `"dddd"`. The precision specifies the
minimum number of digits to appear; if the value being converted can be represented in fewer digits, it is expanded with
leading zeros. The default precision is `1`. The result of converting zero with an explicit precision of zero is no
characters.

* `u` The `unsigned` argument is converted to `unsigned` decimal format in the style `"dddd"`. The precision specifies
the minimum number of digits to appear; if the value being converted can be represented in fewer digits, it is expanded
with leading zeros. The default precision is `1`. The result of converting zero with an explicit precision of zero is
no characters.

* `x` The `unsigned` argument is converted to `unsigned` hexadecimal format in the style `"dddd"`; the letters
`"abcdef"` are used. The precision specifies the minimum number of digits to appear; if the value being converted can be
represented in fewer digits, it is expanded with leading zeros. The default precision is `1`. The result of converting
zero with an explicit precision of zero are no characters.

* `X` Equivalent to the `x` conversion specifier, except that letters `"ABCDEF"` are used instead of `"abcdef"`.

* `f`, `F` The `double` argument is converted to decimal notation in the style `"[-]ddd.ddd"`, where the number of
digits after the radix character is equal to the precision specification. If the precision is missing, it is taken as
`6`; if the precision is explicitly zero and no `'#'` flag is present, no radix character appears. If a radix character
appears, at least one digit appears before it. The low-order digit is rounded.
      A `double` argument representing an infinity is converted in one of the styles `"[-]inf"` or `"[-]infinity"`;
      which style is implementation-defined. A `double` argument representing a `NaN` is converted in one of the styles
      `"[-]nan(n-char-sequence)"` or `"[-]nan"`; which style, and the meaning of any `n-char`-sequence, is
      implementation-defined. The F conversion specifier produces `"INF"`, `"INFINITY"`, or `"NAN"` instead of `"inf"`,
      `"infinity"`, or `"nan"`, respectively.

* `e`, `E` The `double` argument is converted in the style `"[-]d.dddedd"`, where there is one digit before the radix
character (which is non-zero if the argument is non-zero) and the number of digits after it is equal to the precision;
if the precision is missing, it is taken as `6`; if the precision is zero and no `'#'` flag is present, no radix
character appears. The low-order digit is rounded in an implementation-defined manner. The E conversion specifier
produces a number with 'E' instead of 'e' introducing the exponent. The exponent always contains at least two digits.
If the value is zero, the exponent is zero.
           A `double` argument representing an infinity or `NaN` is converted in the style of a `f` or `F`
           conversion specifier.

* `g`, `G` The `double` argument representing a floating-point number is converted in the style `f` or `e`
(or in the style `F` or `E` in the case of a `G` conversion specifier), depending on the value converted and the
precision. Let `P` equal the precision if non-zero, `6` if the precision is omitted, or `1` if the precision is zero.
Then, if a conversion with style `E` would have an exponent of `X`:

  * If `P > X>=-4`, the conversion is with style `f` (or `F`) and precision `P -( X+1)`.

  * Otherwise, the conversion is with style `e` (or `E`) and precision `P -1`.

    Finally, unless the `'#'` flag is used, any trailing zeros are removed from the fractional portion of the result and
    the decimal-point character is removed if there is no fractional portion remaining.

    A `double` argument representing an infinity or `NaN` is converted in the style of a `f` or `F` conversion
    specifier.

* `a`, `A` A `double` argument representing a floating-point number is converted in the style `"[-]0xh.hhhhpd"`, where
there is one hexadecimal digit (which is non-zero if the argument is a normalized floating-point number and is otherwise
unspecified) before the decimal-point character and the number of hexadecimal digits after it is equal to the precision;
if the precision is missing and `FLT_RADIX` is a power of `2`, then the precision is sufficient for an exact
representation of the value; if the precision is missing and `FLT_RADIX` is not a power of `2`, then the precision is
sufficient to distinguish values of type `double`, except that trailing zeros may be omitted; if the precision is zero
and the `'#'` flag is not specified, no decimal-point character shall appear. The letters `"abcdef"` are used for `a`
conversion and the letters `"ABCDEF"` for `A` conversion. The `A` conversion specifier produces a number with `'X'` and
`'P'` instead of `'x'` and `'p'`. The exponent always contains at least one digit, and only as many more digits as
necessary to represent the decimal exponent of `2`. If the value is zero, the exponent is zero.

    A `double` argument representing an infinity or `NaN` is converted in the style of a `f` or `F` conversion
    specifier.

* `c` The int argument is converted to a `unsigned char`, and the resulting byte is written.

     If a `l` (`ell`) qualifier is present, the `wint_t` argument is converted as if by a `ls` conversion
     specification with no precision and an argument that points to a two-element array of type `wchar_t`, the first
     element of which contains the `wint_t` argument to the ls conversion specification and the second element
     contains a null wide character.

* `s` The argument is a pointer to an array of `char`. Bytes from the array are written up to (but not including) any
terminating null byte. If the precision is specified, no more than that many bytes is written. If the precision is not
specified or is greater than the size of the array, the application ensures that the array contains a null byte.

      If an `l` (`ell`) qualifier is present, the argument is a pointer to an array of type `wchar_t`. Wide characters from the array are converted to characters (each as if by a call to the `wcrtomb()` function, with the conversion state described by an `mbstate_t` object initialized to zero before the first wide character is converted) up to and including a terminating null wide character. The resulting characters are written up to (but not including) the terminating null character (byte). If no precision is specified, the application ensures that the array contains a null wide character. If a precision is specified, no more than that many characters (bytes) are written (including shift sequences, if any), and the array contains a null wide character if, to equal the character sequence length given by the precision, the function would need to access a wide character one past the end of the array. In no case a partial character is written.

* `p` The argument is a pointer to `void`. The value of the pointer is converted to a sequence of printable characters,
in an implementation-defined manner.

* `n` The argument is a pointer to a `integer` into which is written the number of bytes written to the output so far
by this call to one of the `fprintf()` functions. No argument is converted.

* `C` Equivalent to `lc`.

* `S` Equivalent to `ls`.

* `%` Print a `'%'` character; no argument is converted. The complete conversion specification is `%%`.

If a conversion specification does not match one of the above forms, the behavior is undefined. If any argument is not
the correct type for the corresponding conversion specification, the behavior is undefined.

In no case a nonexistent or small field width causes truncation of a field; if the result of a conversion is wider than
the field width, the field is expanded to contain the conversion result. Characters generated by `fprintf()` and
`printf()` are printed as if `fputc()` had been called.

For the `a` and `A` conversion specifiers, if `FLT_RADIX` is a power of `2`, the value is correctly rounded to a
hexadecimal floating number with the given precision.

For `a` and `A` conversions, if `FLT_RADIX` is not a power of `2` and the result is not exactly representable in the
given precision, the result should be one of the two adjacent numbers in hexadecimal floating style with the given
precision, with the extra stipulation that the error should have a correct sign for the current rounding direction.

For the `e`, `E`, `f`, `F`, `g`, and `G` conversion specifiers, if the number of significant decimal digits is at most
`DECIMAL_DIG`, then the result should be correctly rounded. If the number of significant decimal digits is more than
`DECIMAL_DIG`, but the source value is exactly representable with `DECIMAL_DIG` digits, then the result should be an
exact representation with trailing zeros. Otherwise, the source value is bounded by two adjacent decimal
strings `L` < `U`, both having `DECIMAL_DIG` significant digits; the value of the resultant decimal string `D` should
satisfy `L <= D <= U`, with the extra stipulation that the error should have a correct sign for
the current rounding direction.

The last data modification and last file status change timestamps of the file is marked for update:

* Between the call to a successful execution of `fprintf()` or `printf()` and the next successful completion of a call
to `fflush()` or `fclose()` on the same stream or a call to `exit()` or `abort()`.

* Upon successful completion of a call to `dprintf()`.

### Return value

On success:

* The `dprintf()`, `fprintf()`, and `printf()` functions return the number of bytes transmitted.

* The `sprintf()` function returns the number of bytes written to _s_, excluding the terminating null byte.

* The `snprintf()` function returns the number of bytes that would be written to _s_ had _n_ been sufficiently
large excluding the terminating null byte.

On output error these functions return `-1` and set `errno` to indicate the error.

If the value of _n_ is zero on a call to `snprintf()`, nothing is written, the number of bytes that would have been
written had _n_ been sufficiently large excluding the terminating null is returned,
and _s_ may be a null pointer.

### Errors

The conditions under which `dprintf()`, `fprintf()`, and `printf()` fail are as follows:

[`EAGAIN`] - The `O_NONBLOCK` flag is set for the file descriptor underlying stream and the thread would be delayed in
the write operation.
[`EBADF`] - The file descriptor underlying stream is not a valid file descriptor open for writing.
[`EFBIG`] - An attempt was made to write to a file that exceeds the maximum file size or
          - An attempt was made to write to a file that exceeds the file size limit of the process or
          - The file is a regular file and an attempt was made to write at or beyond the offset maximum.
[`EINTR`] - The write operation was terminated due to the receipt of a signal, and no data was transferred.
[`EIO`] - A physical I/O error has occurred, or the process is a member of a background process group attempting to
write to its controlling terminal, `TOSTOP` is set, the calling thread is not blocking `SIGTTOU`, the process is not
ignoring `SIGTTOU`, and the process group of the process is orphaned. This error may also be returned under
implementation-defined conditions.
[`ENOSPC`] - There was no free space remaining on the device containing the file.
[`EPIPE`] - An attempt is made to write to a pipe or FIFO that is not open for reading by any process. A `SIGPIPE`
signal shall also be sent to the thread.
[`ENOMEM`] - Insufficient storage space is available.
[`ENXIO`] - A request was made of a nonexistent device, or the request was outside the capabilities of the device.

[`EILSEQ`] - A wide-character code that does not correspond to a valid character has been detected.
[`EOVERFLOW`] - The value to be returned or the value of _n_ is greater than {`INT_MAX`}.

The `dprintf()`, `fprintf()`, and `printf()` functions fail if:

[`ENOMEM`] - Insufficient storage space is available.

### Examples

The following example prints a series of wide characters. Suppose that `"L`@`"` expands to three bytes:

`wchar_t wz [3] = L"@@";       // Zero-terminated`

`wchar_t wn [3] = L"@@@";      // Unterminated`

`fprintf (stdout,"%ls", wz);   // Outputs 6 bytes`

`fprintf (stdout,"%ls", wn);   // Undefined because wn has no terminator`

`fprintf (stdout,"%4ls", wz);  // Outputs 3 bytes`

`fprintf (stdout,"%4ls", wn);  // Outputs 3 bytes; no terminator needed`

`fprintf (stdout,"%9ls", wz);  // Outputs 6 bytes`

`fprintf (stdout,"%9ls", wn);  // Outputs 9 bytes; no terminator needed`

`fprintf (stdout,"%10ls", wz); // Outputs 6 bytes`

`fprintf (stdout,"%10ls", wn); // Undefined because wn has no terminator`

In the last line of the example, after processing three characters, nine bytes have been output. The fourth character
must then be examined to determine whether it converts to one byte or more. If it converts to more than one byte, the
output is only nine bytes. Since there is no fourth character in the array, the behavior is undefined.

### Implementation tasks

* implement wide characters,
* implement error detection
