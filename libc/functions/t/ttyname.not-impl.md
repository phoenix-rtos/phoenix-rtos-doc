# Synopsis 
`#include <unistd.h>`

` char *ttyname(int fildes);`

` int ttyname_r(int fildes, char *name, size_t namesize);`


## Status
Declared, not implemented
## Conformance
IEEE Std 1003.1-2017
## Description


The `ttyname()` function shall return a pointer to a string containing a null-terminated pathname of the terminal
associated with file descriptor _fildes_. The application shall not modify the string returned. The returned pointer might be
invalidated or the string content might be overwritten by a subsequent call to `ttyname()`. The returned pointer and the
string content might also be invalidated if the calling thread is terminated.

The `ttyname()` function need not be thread-safe.

The `ttyname_r()` function shall store the null-terminated pathname of the terminal associated with the file descriptor
_fildes_ in the character array referenced by _name_. The array is _namesize_ characters long and should have space
for the _name_ and the terminating null character. The maximum length of the terminal name shall be `TTY_NAME_MAX`.


## Return value


Upon successful completion, `ttyname()` shall return a pointer to a string. Otherwise, a null pointer shall be returned and
errno set to indicate the error.

If successful, the `ttyname_r()` function shall return zero. Otherwise, an error number shall be returned to indicate the
error.


## Errors


The `ttyname()` function may fail if:


 * `EBADF` - The _fildes_ argument is not a valid file descriptor.

 * `ENOTTY` - The file associated with the _fildes_ argument is not a terminal.

The `ttyname_r()` function may fail if:


 * `EBADF` - The _fildes_ argument is not a valid file descriptor.

 * `ENOTTY` - The file associated with the _fildes_ argument is not a terminal.

 * `ERANGE` - The value of _namesize_ is smaller than the length of the string to be returned including the terminating null
character.
