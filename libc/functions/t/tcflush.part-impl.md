`int tcflush(int fildes, int queue_selector);`

<!-- #MUST_BE: check status according to implementation -->
## Status

Partially implemented

<!-- #MUST_BE: if function shall be posix compliant print the standard signature  -->
## Conformance

IEEE Std 1003.1-2017

## Description 
 
`tcflush()` - flush non-transmitted output data, non-read input data, or both

Upon successful completion, `tcflush()` shall discard data written to the object referred to by _fildes_ (an open file descriptor associated with a terminal) but not transmitted, or data received but not read, depending on the value of _queue_selector_:

* If _queue_selector_ is `TCIFLUSH`, it shall flush data received but not read.

* If _queue_selector_ is `TCOFLUSH`, it shall flush data written but not transmitted.

* If _queue_selector_ is `TCIOFLUSH`, it shall flush both data received but not read and data written but not transmitted.

Attempts to use `tcflush()` from a process which is a member of a background process group on a _fildes_ associated with its controlling terminal shall cause the process group to be sent a `SIGTTOU` signal. If the calling thread is blocking `SIGTTOU` signals or the process is ignoring `SIGTTOU` signals, the process shall be allowed to perform the operation, and no signal is sent.

<!-- #MUST_BE: check return values by the function  -->
## Return value

Upon successful completion, `0` shall be returned. Otherwise, `-1` shall be returned and `errno` set to indicate the error.

<!-- #MUST_BE: check what errors can cause the function to fail  -->
## Errors

The `tcflush()` function shall fail if:

* `EBADF` - The _fildes_ argument is not a valid file descriptor.

* `EINVAL` - The _queue_selector_ argument is not a supported value.

* `EIO` - The process group of the writing process is orphaned, the calling thread is not blocking SIGTTOU, and the process is not ignoring SIGTTOU.

* `ENOTTY` - The file associated with _fildes_ is not a terminal.
