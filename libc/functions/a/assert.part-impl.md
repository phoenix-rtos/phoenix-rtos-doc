# Synopsis 
`#include <assert.h>`</br>

` void assert(scalar expression);`</br>

## Status
Partially implemented
## Conformance
IEEE Std 1003.1-2017
## Description


The purpose is to insert program diagnostics. The `assert()` macro shall insert diagnostics into programs, it shall expand to a `void` expression. When it is
executed, if _expression_ (which shall have a scalar type) is false (that is, compares equal to `0`), `assert()`
shall write information about the particular call that failed on stderr and shall call `abort()`.

The information written about the call that failed shall include the text of the argument, the name of the source file, the
source file line number, and the name of the enclosing function, the latter are, respectively, the values of the preprocessing
macros `__FILE__` and `__LINE__` and of the identifier `__func__`.

Forcing a definition of the name `NDEBUG`, either from the compiler command line or with the preprocessor control statement
`#define NDEBUG` ahead of the `#include <assert.h>` statement, shall
stop assertions from being compiled into the program.


## Return value

The `assert()` macro shall not return a value.


## Errors


No errors are defined.


## Tests

Untested

## Known bugs

None
