# Synopsis 
`#include <stdlib.h>`</br>

` int atexit(void (*func)(void));`</br>

## Status
Partially implemented
## Conformance
IEEE Std 1003.1-2017
## Description


The purpose is to register a function to run at process termination. The `atexit()` function shall register the function pointed to by _func_, to be called without arguments at normal
program termination. At normal program termination, all functions registered by the `atexit()` function shall be called, in
the reverse order of their registration, except that a function is called after any previously registered functions that had
already been called at the time it was registered. Normal termination occurs either by a call to `exit()` or a return from `main()`.

At least 32 functions can be registered with `atexit()`.
After a successful call to any of the exec functions, any functions previously
registered by `atexit()` shall no longer be registered. 


## Return value

Upon successful completion, `atexit()` shall return `0`, otherwise, it shall return a non-zero value.

## Errors


No errors are defined.


## Tests

Untested

## Known bugs

None
