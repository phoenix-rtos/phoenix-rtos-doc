# Synopsis

`#include <unistd.h>`

`unsigned int alarm(unsigned int seconds);`

## Status

Implemented

## Conformance

IEEE Std 1003.1-2017

## Description

The `alarm()` function delivers alarm (`SIGALARM`) to the calling process after number of <u>seconds</u> specified.

### Arguments

`seconds` - number of seconds to wait.

Processor scheduling delays may prevent the process from handling the signal as soon as it is generated.
If seconds is `0`, a pending alarm request, if any, is canceled.

## Return value

If there is a previous `alarm()` request with time remaining, `alarm()` returns a non-zero value that is the number of seconds until the previous request would have generated a `SIGALRM` signal. Otherwise, `alarm()` returns `0`.

## Errors

No errors are defined.

## Comments

Alarm requests are not stacked; only one `SIGALRM` generation can be scheduled in this manner. If the `SIGALRM` signal has not yet been generated, the call shall result in rescheduling the time at which the `SIGALRM` signal is generated.
