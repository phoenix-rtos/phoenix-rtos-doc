# Synopsis 
`#include <unistd.h>`

` int setuid(uid_t uid);`

## Status
Declared, not implemented
## Conformance
IEEE Std 1003.1-2017
## Description


If the process has appropriate privileges, `setuid()` shall set the real user ID, effective user ID, and the saved
set-user-ID of the calling process to _uid_.

If the process does not have appropriate privileges, but _uid_ is equal to the real user ID or the saved set-user-ID,
`setuid()` shall set the effective user ID to _uid_; the real user ID and saved set-user-ID shall remain unchanged.

The `setuid()` function shall not affect the supplementary group list in any way.


## Return value


Upon successful completion, 0 shall be returned. Otherwise, -1 shall be returned and `errno` set to indicate the error.


## Errors


The `setuid()` function shall fail, return -1, and set `errno` to the corresponding value if one or more of the
following are true:


 * `EINVAL` - The value of the _uid_ argument is invalid and not supported by the implementation.

 * `EPERM` - The process does not have appropriate privileges and _uid_ does not match the real user ID or the saved set-user-ID.
