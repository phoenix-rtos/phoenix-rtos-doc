# Synopsis 
`#include <string.h>`</br>

` int strncmp(const char *s1, const char *s2, size_t n);`</br>

## Status
Partially implemented
## Conformance
IEEE Std 1003.1-2017
## Description


The `strncmp()` function shall compare not more than _n_ bytes (bytes that follow a NUL character are not compared)
from the array pointed to by _s1_ to the array pointed to by _s2_.
The sign of a non-zero return value is determined by the sign of the difference between the values of the first pair of bytes
(both interpreted as type `unsigned char`) that differ in the strings being compared.


## Return value


Upon successful completion, `strncmp()` shall return an integer greater than, equal to, or less than `0`, if the possibly
null-terminated array pointed to by _s1_ is greater than, equal to, or less than the possibly null-terminated array pointed to
by _s2_ respectively.
