# Synopsis 
`#include <unistd.h>`

` int seteuid(uid_t uid);`

## Status
Declared, not implemented
## Conformance
IEEE Std 1003.1-2017
## Description


If _uid_ is equal to the real user ID or the saved set-user-ID, or if the process has appropriate privileges,
`seteuid()` shall set the effective user ID of the calling process to _uid_; the real user ID and saved set-user-ID shall
remain unchanged.

The `seteuid()` function shall not affect the supplementary group list in any way.


## Return value


Upon successful completion, 0 shall be returned; otherwise, -1 shall be returned and `errno` set to indicate the error.


## Errors


The `seteuid()` function shall fail if:


 * `EINVAL` - The value of the _uid_ argument is invalid and is not supported by the implementation.

 * `EPERM` - The process does not have appropriate privileges and _uid_ does not match the real user ID or the saved set-user-ID.
