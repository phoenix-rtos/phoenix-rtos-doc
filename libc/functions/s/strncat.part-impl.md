# Synopsis 
`#include <string.h>`</br>

` char *strncat(char *restrict s1, const char *restrict s2, size_t n);`</br>

## Status
Partially implemented
## Conformance
IEEE Std 1003.1-2017
## Description

The `strncat()` function shall append not more than _n_ bytes (a `NUL` character and bytes that follow it are not
appended) from the array pointed to by _s2_ to the end of the string pointed to by _s1_. The initial byte of _s2_
overwrites the `NUL` character at the end of _s1_. A terminating NUL character is always appended to the result. If copying
takes place between objects that overlap, the behavior is undefined.


## Return value


The `strncat()` function shall return _s1_; no return value shall be reserved to indicate an error.


## Errors


No errors are defined.


## Tests

Untested

## Known bugs

None
