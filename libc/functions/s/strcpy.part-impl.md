# Synopsis 
`#include <string.h>`</br>

`char *stpcpy(char *restrict s1, const char *restrict s2); `</br>

` char *strcpy(char *restrict s1, const char *restrict s2);`</br>

## Status
Partially implemented
## Conformance
IEEE Std 1003.1-2017
## Description



The  `stpcpy()`  Â and `strcpy()` functions shall copy the
string pointed to by _s2_ (including the terminating `NUL` character) into the array pointed to by _s1_.
If copying takes place between objects that overlap, the behavior is undefined.


## Return value


The
`stpcpy()` function shall return a pointer to the terminating `NUL` character copied into the _s1_ buffer. 
The `strcpy()` function shall return _s1_.
No return values are reserved to indicate an error.


## Errors


No errors are defined.


## Tests

Untested

## Known bugs
