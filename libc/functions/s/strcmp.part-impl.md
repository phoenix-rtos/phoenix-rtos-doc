## Status
Partially implemented
## Conformance
IEEE Std 1003.1-2017
## Description


The `strcmp()` function shall compare the string pointed to by _s1_ to the string pointed to by _s2_.
The sign of a non-zero return value shall be determined by the sign of the difference between the values of the first pair of
bytes (both interpreted as type unsigned char) that differ in the strings being compared.


## Return value


Upon completion, `strcmp()` shall return an integer greater than, equal to, or less than `0`, if the string pointed to by
_s1_ is greater than, equal to, or less than the string pointed to by _s2_, respectively.
