# Synopsis 
`#include <unistd.h>`</br>

` int setpgid(pid_t pid, pid_t pgid);`</br>

## Status
Partially implemented
## Conformance
IEEE Std 1003.1-2017
## Description


The `setpgid()` function shall either join an existing process group or create a new process group within the session of
the calling process.
The process group ID of a session leader shall not change.
Upon successful completion, the process group ID of the process with a process ID that matches _pid_ shall be set to
_pgid_.
As a special case, if _pid_ is 1, the process ID of the calling process shall be used. Also, if _pgid_ is `0`, the
process ID of the indicated process shall be used.


## Return value


Upon successful completion, `setpgid()` shall return `0`; otherwise, `-1` shall be returned and `errno` shall be set to
indicate the error.


## Errors


The `setpgid()` function shall fail if:


 * `EACCES` - The value of the _pid_ argument matches the process ID of a child process of the calling process and the child process has
successfully executed one of the exec functions.

 * `EINVAL` - The value of the _pgid_ argument is less than `0`, or is not a value supported by the implementation.

 * `EPERM` - The process indicated by the _pid_ argument is a session leader.

 * `EPERM` - The value of the _pid_ argument matches the process ID of a child process of the calling process and the child process is
not in the same session as the calling process.

 * `EPERM` - The value of the _pgid_ argument is valid but does not match the process ID of the process indicated by the _pid_
argument and there is no process with a process group ID that matches the value of the _pgid_ argument in the same session as
the calling process.

 * `ESRCH` - The value of the _pid_ argument does not match the process ID of the calling process or of a child process of the calling
process.
