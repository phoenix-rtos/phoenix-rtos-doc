# Synopsis 
`#include <setjmp.h>`</br>

` int setjmp(jmp_buf env);`</br>

## Status
Partially implemented
## Conformance
IEEE Std 1003.1-2017
## Description

A call to `setjmp()` shall save the calling environment in its _env_ argument for later use by `longjmp()`.
It is unspecified whether `setjmp()` is a macro or a function. If a macro definition is suppressed in order to access an
actual function, or a program defines an external identifier with the name `setjmp`, the behavior is undefined.
An application shall ensure that an invocation of `setjmp()` appears in one of the following contexts only:



* The entire controlling expression of a selection or iteration statement


* One operand of a relational or equality operator with the other operand an integral constant expression, with the resulting expression being the entire controlling expression of a selection or iteration statement





* The operand of a unary `!` operator with the resulting expression being the entire controlling expression of a selection or iteration





* The entire expression of an expression statement (possibly cast to `void`)




If the invocation appears in any other context, the behavior is undefined.


## Return value


If the return is from a direct invocation, `setjmp()` shall return `0`. If the return is from a call to `longjmp()`, `setjmp()` shall return a non-zero value.


## Errors


No errors are defined.


## Tests

Untested

## Known bugs

None
