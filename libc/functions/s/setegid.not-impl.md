# Synopsis 
`#include <unistd.h>`

` int setegid(gid_t gid);`


## Status
Declared, not implemented
## Conformance
IEEE Std 1003.1-2017
## Description


If _gid_ is equal to the real group ID or the saved set-group-ID, or if the process has appropriate privileges,
`setegid()` shall set the effective group ID of the calling process to _gid_; the real group ID, saved set-group-ID, and
any supplementary group IDs shall remain unchanged.

The `setegid()` function shall not affect the supplementary group list in any way.


## Return value


Upon successful completion, 0 shall be returned; otherwise, -1 shall be returned and `errno` set to indicate the error.


## Errors


The `setegid()` function shall fail if:


 * `EINVAL` - The value of the _gid_ argument is invalid and is not supported by the implementation.

 * `EPERM` - The process does not have appropriate privileges and _gid_ does not match the real group ID or the saved
set-group-ID.
