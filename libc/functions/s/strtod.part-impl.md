## Description


These functions shall convert the initial portion of the string pointed to by _nptr_ to `double`, `float`, and
`long double` representation, respectively. First, they decompose the input string into three parts:


 * An initial, possibly empty, sequence of white-space characters (as specified by `isspace()`)


 * A subject sequence interpreted as a floating-point constant or representing infinity or `NaN`


 * A final string of one or more unrecognized characters, including the terminating NUL character of the input string


Then they shall attempt to convert the subject sequence to a floating-point number, and return the result.


The expected form of the subject sequence is an optional `+` or `-` sign, then one of the following:



* A non-empty sequence of decimal digits optionally containing a `radix` character; then an optional exponent part consisting of the character `e` or the character `E`, optionally followed by a `+` or `-` character, and then
 followed by one or more decimal digits





* A `0x` or `0X`, then a non-empty sequence of hexadecimal digits optionally containing a radix character; then an optional binary
 exponent part consisting of the character `p` or the character `P`, optionally followed by a `+` or `-` character, and then followed by one or more decimal digits





* One of `INF` or `INFINITY`, ignoring case





* One of `NAN` or `NAN(n-char-sequenceopt)`, ignoring case in the `NAN` part, where:

```
n-char-sequence:
    digit
    nondigit
    n-char-sequence digit
    n-char-sequence nondigit
```







The subject sequence is defined as the longest initial subsequence of the input string, starting with the first non-white-space
character, that is of the expected form. The subject sequence contains no characters if the input string is not of the expected
form.


If the subject sequence has the expected form for a floating-point number, the sequence of characters starting with the first
digit or the decimal-point character (whichever occurs first) shall be interpreted as a floating constant of the C language, except
that the `radix` character shall be used in place of a period, and that if neither an exponent part nor a `radix` character appears in
a decimal floating-point number, or if a binary exponent part does not appear in a hexadecimal floating-point number, an exponent
part of the appropriate type with value zero is assumed to follow the last digit in the string. If the subject sequence begins with
a `<hyphen-minus>`, the sequence shall be interpreted as negated. A character sequence `INF` or `INFINITY` shall be interpreted as
an infinity, if representable in the return type, else as if it were a floating constant that is too large for the range of the
return type. A character sequence `NAN` or `NAN(n-char-sequenceopt)` shall be interpreted as a quiet
NaN, if supported in the return type, else as if it were a subject sequence part that does not have the expected form; the meaning
of the n-char sequences is implementation-defined. A pointer to the final string is stored in the object pointed to by
_endptr_, provided that _endptr_ is not a `null` pointer.

If the subject sequence has the hexadecimal form and `FLT_RADIX` is a power of 2, the value resulting from the conversion is
correctly rounded.

The
`radix` character is defined in the current locale (category `LC_NUMERIC)`. In the POSIX locale, or in a locale where the `radix`
character is not defined, the `radix` character shall default to a `<period>` ( `.` ). 

In other than the C    or POSIX  locale, additional
locale-specific subject sequence forms may be accepted.

If the subject sequence is empty or does not have the expected form, no conversion shall be performed; the value of nptr
is stored in the object pointed to by _endptr_, provided that _endptr_ is not a `null` pointer.

These functions shall not change the setting of `errno` if successful.
Since `0` is returned on error and is also a valid return on success, an application wishing to check for error situations should
set `errno` to `0`, then call `strtod()`, `strtof()`, or `strtold()`, then check `errno`.


## Return value


Upon successful completion, these functions shall return the converted value. If no conversion could be performed, `0` shall be
returned, and `errno` may be set to `EINVAL`.
If the correct value is outside the range of representable values, ±HUGE_VAL, ±HUGE_VALF, or ±HUGE_VALL
shall be returned (according to the sign of the value), and errno shall be set to `ERANGE`.
If the correct value would cause an underflow, a value whose magnitude is no greater than the smallest normalized positive
number in the return type shall be returned and `errno` set to `ERANGE`.


## Errors


These functions shall fail if:


 * `ERANGE` - The value to be returned would cause overflow    or underflow. 

These functions may fail if:


 * `EINVAL` -   No
conversion could be performed.
