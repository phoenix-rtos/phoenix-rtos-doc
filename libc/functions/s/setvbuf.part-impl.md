# Synopsis 
`#include <stdio.h>`</br>

` int setvbuf(FILE *restrict stream, char *restrict buf, int type,`</br>
`        size_t size);`</br>

## Status
Partially implemented
## Conformance
IEEE Std 1003.1-2017
## Description


The `setvbuf()` function may be used after the stream pointed to by _stream_ is associated with an open file but
before any other operation (other than an unsuccessful call to `setvbuf()`) is performed on the stream. The argument
type determines how stream shall be buffered, as follows:



* `_IOFB` shall cause input/output to be fully buffered.





* `_IOLB` shall cause input/output to be line buffered.





* `_IONB` shall cause input/output to be unbuffered.




If _buf_ is not a `null` pointer, the array it points to may be used instead of a buffer allocated by `setvbuf()` and
the argument size specifies the size of the array; otherwise, size may determine the size of a buffer allocated by
the `setvbuf()` function. The contents of the array at any time are unspecified.
For information about streams, see Standard I/O Streams.


## Return value


Upon successful completion, `setvbuf()` shall return `0`. Otherwise, it shall return a non-zero value if an invalid value is
given for type or if the request cannot be honored,  and may set `errno` to indicate the error. 


## Errors


The `setvbuf()` function may fail if:


 * `EBADF` - The file descriptor underlying stream is not valid.
