# Synopsis 
`#include <string.h>`</br>

` char *strcat(char *restrict s1, const char *restrict s2);`</br>

## Status
Partially implemented
## Conformance
IEEE Std 1003.1-2017
## Description


The `strcat()` function shall append a copy of the string pointed to by _s2_ (including the terminating `NUL` character)
to the end of the string pointed to by _s1_. The initial byte of _s2_ overwrites the `NUL` character at the end of
_s1_. If copying takes place between objects that overlap, the behavior is undefined.


## Return value


The `strcat()` function shall return _s1_; no return value is reserved to indicate an error.


## Errors


No errors are defined.


## Tests

Untested

## Known bugs

None
