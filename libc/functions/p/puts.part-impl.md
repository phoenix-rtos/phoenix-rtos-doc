## Status
Partially implemented
## Conformance
IEEE Std 1003.1-2017
## Description


The `puts()` function shall write the string pointed to by _s_, followed by a `<newline>`, to the standard output
stream stdout. The terminating `null` byte shall not be written.

The
last data modification and last file status change timestamps of the file shall be marked for update between the successful
execution of `puts()` and the next successful completion of a call to `fflush()`
or `fclose()` on the same stream or a call to `exit()` or `abort()`. 


## Return value


Upon successful completion, `puts()` shall return a non-negative number. Otherwise, it shall return `EOF`, shall set an error
indicator for the stream,   Â and `errno` shall be set to indicate the error. 


## Errors

Refer to `fputc()`.


## Tests

Untested

## Known bugs
