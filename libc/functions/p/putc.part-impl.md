## Status
Partially implemented
## Conformance
IEEE Std 1003.1-2017
## Description

The `putc()` function shall be equivalent to `fputc()`, except that if it is
implemented as a macro it may evaluate stream more than once, so the argument should never be an expression with
side-effects.


## Return value


Refer to fputc.


## Errors


Refer to fputc.




## Tests

Untested

## Known bugs

None
