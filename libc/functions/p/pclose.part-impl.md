# Synopsis 
`#include <stdio.h>`</br>

`int pclose(FILE *stream);`</br>

## Status
Implemented
## Conformance
IEEE Std 1003.1-2017
## Description

The `pclose()` function shall close a stream that was opened by `popen()`, wait for the command to terminate, and return the termination status of the process that was running the command language interpreter. However, if a call caused the termination status to be unavailable to `pclose()`, then `pclose()` shall return `-1` with `errno` set to `ECHILD` to report this situation. This can happen if the application calls one of the following functions:

* `wait()`

* `waitpid()` with a pid argument less than or equal to 0 or equal to the process ID of the command line interpreter

* Any other function not defined in this volume of `POSIX.1-2017` that could do one of the above

In any case, `pclose()` shall not return before the child process created by `popen()` has terminated.

If the command language interpreter cannot be executed, the child termination status returned by `pclose()` shall be as if the command language interpreter terminated using `exit(127)` or `_exit(127)`.

The `pclose()` function shall not affect the termination status of any child of the calling process other than the one created by `popen()` for the associated stream.

If the argument _stream_ to `pclose()` is not a pointer to a stream created by `popen()`, the result of `pclose()` is undefined.

If a thread is canceled during execution of `pclose()`, the behavior is undefined.


## Return value


Upon successful return, `pclose()` shall return the termination status of the command language interpreter. Otherwise, `pclose()` shall return `-1` and set `errno` to indicate the error.


## Errors


The `pclose()` function shall fail if:

 * `ECHILD` - The status of the child process could not be obtained, as described above.
