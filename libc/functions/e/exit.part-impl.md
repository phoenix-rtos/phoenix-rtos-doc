# Synopsis 
`#include <stdlib.h>`</br>

` void exit(int status);`</br>

## Status
Partially implemented
## Conformance
IEEE Std 1003.1-2017
## Description

The value of _status_ may be 0, `EXIT_SUCCESS,` `EXIT_FAILURE,`    or any other value, though only the least significant 8 bits
(that is, `(_status_ & 0377)`) shall be available from `wait()` and `waitpid()`. The full value shall be available from `waitid()` and in the `siginfo_t` passed to a signal handler for `SIGCHLD`.
The `exit()` function shall first call all functions registered by `atexit()`,
in the reverse order of their registration, except that a function is called after any previously registered functions that had
already been called at the time it was registered. Each function is called as many times as it was registered. If, during the call
to any such function, a call to the `longjmp()` function is made that would terminate
the call to the registered function, the behavior is undefined.

If a function registered by a call to `atexit()` fails to return, the remaining
registered functions shall not be called and the rest of the `exit()` processing shall not be completed. If `exit()` is
called more than once, the behavior is undefined.

The `exit()` function shall then flush all open streams with unwritten buffered data and close all open streams. Finally,
the process shall be terminated    with the same consequences as described in Consequences of Process Termination. 


## Return value


The `exit()` function does not return.


## Errors


No errors are defined.
