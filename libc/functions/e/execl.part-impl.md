## Description


The `exec` family of functions shall replace the current process image with a new process image. The new image shall be
constructed from a regular, executable file called the new process image file. There shall be no return from a successful
`exec`, because the calling process image is overlaid by the new process image.

The `fexecve()` function shall be equivalent to the `execve()` function except that the file to be executed is
determined by the file descriptor `fd` instead of a pathname. The file offset of `fd` is ignored.

When a C-language program is executed as a result of a call to one of the `exec` family of functions, it shall be entered
as a C-language function call as follows:

`int main (int argc, char *argv[]);`


where _argc_ is the argument count and _argv_ is an array of character pointers to the arguments themselves. In
addition, the following variable, which must be declared by the user if it is to be used directly:

`extern char **environ;`


is initialized as a pointer to an array of character pointers to the environment strings. The _argv_ and _environ_
arrays are each terminated by a `null` pointer. The `null` pointer terminating the _argv_ array is not counted in _argc_.

Applications can change the entire environment in a single operation by assigning the _environ_ variable to point to an
array of character pointers to the new environment strings. After assigning a new value to `environ`, applications should not
rely on the new environment strings remaining part of the environment, as a call to `getenv()`, `putenv()`,  `setenv()`, `unsetenv()`, or any function that is dependent on an environment variable may, on noticing
that _environ_ has changed, copy the environment strings to a new array and assign _environ_ to point to it.

Any application that directly modifies the pointers to which the _environ_ variable points has undefined behavior.

Conforming multi-threaded applications shall not use the _environ_ variable to access or modify any environment variable
while any other thread is concurrently modifying any environment variable. A call to any function dependent on any environment
variable shall be considered a use of the _environ_ variable to access that environment variable.

The arguments specified by a program with one of the `exec` functions shall be passed on to the new process image in the
corresponding `main()` arguments.

The argument _path_ points to a pathname that identifies the new process image file.

The argument file is used to construct a pathname that identifies the new process image file. If the file argument
contains a `<slash>` character, the file argument shall be used as the pathname for this file. Otherwise, the path
prefix for this file is obtained by a search of the directories passed as the environment variable `PATH` (see `XBD` Environment Variables). If this environment variable is not present, the results of
the search are implementation-defined.

There are two distinct ways in which the contents of the process image file may cause the execution to fail, distinguished by
the setting of `errno` to either `ENOEXEC` or `EINVAL` (see the `ERRORS` section). In the cases where the other members of the
`exec` family of functions would fail and set `errno` to `ENOEXEC`, the `execlp()` and `execvp()` functions
shall execute a command interpreter and the environment of the executed command shall be as if the process invoked the sh utility using `execl()` as follows:

`execl(<shell path>, arg0, file, arg1, ..., (char *)0);`


where `<shellÂ path>` is an unspecified pathname for the `sh` utility,
file is the process image file, and for `execvp()`, where _arg0_, _arg1_, and so on correspond to the values
passed to `execvp()` in _argv[0]_, _argv[1]_, and so on.

The arguments represented by _arg0_,... are pointers to `null`-terminated character strings. These strings shall constitute
the argument list available to the new process image. The list is terminated by a `null` pointer. The argument _arg0_ should
point to a filename string that is associated with the process being started by one of the `exec` functions.

The argument _argv_ is an array of character pointers to `null`-terminated strings. The application shall ensure that the
last member of this array is a `null` pointer. These strings shall constitute the argument list available to the new process image.

The value in _argv[0]_ should point to a filename string that is associated with the process being started by one of the
`exec` functions.

The argument _envp_ is an array of character pointers to `null`-terminated strings. These strings shall constitute the
environment for the new process image. The _envp_ array is terminated by a `null` pointer.

For those forms not containing an _envp_ pointer (`execl()`, `execv()`, `execlp()`, and `execvp()`),
the environment for the new process image shall be taken from the external variable _environ_ in the calling process.

The number of bytes available for the new process' combined argument and environment lists is ``ARG_MAX``. It is
implementation-defined whether `null` terminators, pointers, and/or any alignment bytes are included in this total.

File descriptors open in the calling process image shall remain open in the new process image, except for those whose close-on-
`exec` flag `FD_CLOEXEC` is set. For those file descriptors that remain open, all attributes of the open file description remain
unchanged. For any file descriptor that is closed for this reason, file locks are removed as a result of the close as described in
`close()`. Locks that are not removed by closing of file descriptors remain
unchanged.

If file descriptor `0`, `1`, or `2` would otherwise be closed after a successful call to one of the `exec` family of functions,
implementations may open an unspecified file for the file descriptor in the new process image. If a standard utility or a
conforming application is executed with file descriptor `0` not open for reading or with file descriptor `1` or `2` not open for writing,
the environment in which the utility or application is executed shall be deemed non-conforming, and consequently the utility or
application might not behave as described in this standard.

Directory streams open in the calling process image shall be closed in the new process image.

The state of the floating-point environment in the initial thread of the new process image shall be set to the default.

The state of conversion descriptors and message catalog descriptors in the new process image is undefined.

For the new process image, the equivalent of:

`setlocale(LC_ALL, "C")`


shall be executed at start-up.

Signals set to the default action `(SIG_DFL)` in the calling process image shall be set to the default action in the new process
image. Except for `SIGCHLD`, signals set to be ignored `(SIG_IGN)` by the calling process image shall be set to be ignored by the new
process image. Signals set to be caught by the calling process image shall be set to the default action in the new process image
(see `<signal.h>`).

If the `SIGCHLD` signal is set to be ignored by the calling process image, it is unspecified whether the `SIGCHLD` signal is set to
be ignored or to the default action in the new process image.
After a successful call to any of the `exec` functions, alternate signal stacks are not preserved and the `SA_ONSTACK`
flag shall be cleared for all signals. 
After a successful call to any of the `exec` functions, any functions previously registered by the `atexit()` or ``pthread_atfork()`` functions
are no longer registered.
If the `ST_NOSUID` bit is set for the file system containing the new process image file, then the effective user ID, effective group
ID, saved set-user-ID, and saved set-group-ID are unchanged in the new process image. Otherwise,  if the set-user-ID mode bit of the new process image file is set, the effective user ID of the new
process image shall be set to the user ID of the new process image file. Similarly, if the set-group-ID mode bit of the new process
image file is set, the effective group ID of the new process image shall be set to the group ID of the new process image file. The
real user ID, real group ID, and supplementary group IDs of the new process image shall remain the same as those of the calling
process image. The effective user ID and effective group ID of the new process image shall be saved (as the saved set-user-ID and
the saved set-group-ID) for use by `setuid()`.
Any shared memory segments attached to the calling process image shall not be attached to the new process image. 
Any named semaphores open in the calling process shall be closed as if by appropriate calls to ``sem_close()``.
Any blocks of typed memory that were mapped in the calling process are unmapped, as if `munmap()` was implicitly called to unmap them. 
Memory locks established by the calling process via calls to `mlockall()` or `mlock()` shall be removed. If locked pages in the address space of the calling process are also
mapped into the address spaces of other processes and are locked by those processes, the locks established by the other processes
shall be unaffected by the call by this process to the `exec` function. If the `exec` function fails, the effect on
memory locks is unspecified. 
Memory mappings created in the process are unmapped before the address space is rebuilt for the new process image.

When the calling process image does not use the `SCHED_FIFO,` `SCHED_RR,`
or `SCHED_SPORADIC`  Â scheduling policies, the scheduling policy and parameters of the new process image and the initial
thread in that new process image are implementation-defined.
When the calling process image uses the `SCHED_FIFO,` `SCHED_RR,` or `SCHED_SPORADIC` scheduling policies, the process policy and
scheduling parameter settings shall not be changed by a call to an `exec` function.Â The initial thread in the new process image shall inherit the process scheduling policy and
parameters. It shall have the default system contention scope, but shall inherit its allocation domain from the calling process
image. 
Per-process timers created by the calling process shall be deleted before replacing the current process image with the new
process image.
All open message queue descriptors in the calling process shall be closed, as described in ``mq_close()``. 
Any outstanding asynchronous I/O operations may be canceled. Those asynchronous I/O operations that are not canceled shall
complete as if the `exec` function had not yet occurred, but any associated signal notifications shall be suppressed. It is
unspecified whether the `exec` function itself blocks awaiting such I/O completion. In no event, however, shall the new
process image created by the `exec` function be affected by the presence of outstanding asynchronous I/O operations at the
time the `exec` function is called. Whether any I/O is canceled, and which I/O may be canceled upon `exec`, is
implementation-defined.
The new process image shall inherit the CPU-time clock of the calling process image. This inheritance means that the process
CPU-time clock of the process being exec-ed shall not be reinitialized or altered as a result of the `exec` function
other than to reflect the time spent by the process executing the `exec` function itself. 
The initial value of the CPU-time clock of the initial thread of the new process image shall be set to zero. 
If the calling process is being traced, the new process image shall continue to be traced into the same trace stream as the
original process image, but the new process image shall not inherit the mapping of trace event names to trace event type
identifiers that was defined by calls to the ``posix_trace_eventid_open()`` or the ``posix_trace_trid_eventid_open()`` functions in the calling process
image.

If the calling process is a trace controller process, any trace streams that were created by the calling process shall be shut
down as described in the ``posix_trace_shutdown()`` function. 
The thread ID of the initial thread in the new process image is unspecified.

The size and location of the stack on which the initial thread in the new process image runs is unspecified.

The initial thread in the new process image shall have its cancellation type set to `PTHREAD_CANCEL_DEFERRED` and its cancellation
state set to `PTHREAD_CANCEL_ENABLED`.

The initial thread in the new process image shall have all thread-specific data values set to `null` and all thread-specific data
keys shall be removed by the call to `exec` without running destructors.

The initial thread in the new process image shall be joinable, as if created with the detachstate attribute set to
`PTHREAD_CREATE_JOINABLE`.

The new process shall inherit at least the following attributes from the calling process image:



* Nice value (see `nice()`) 





* semadj values (see `semop()`) 





* Process ID





* Parent process ID





* Process group ID





* Session membership





* Real user ID





* Real group ID





* Supplementary group IDs





* Time left until an alarm clock signal (see `alarm()`)





* Current working directory





* Root directory





* File mode creation mask (see `umask()`)





* File size limit (see `getrlimit()` and `setrlimit()`) 





* Process signal mask (see `pthread_sigmask()`)





* Pending signal (see `sigpending()`)





* `tms_utime,` `tms_stime,` `tms_cutime,` and `tms_cstime` (see `times()`)




* Resource limits 





* Controlling terminal





* Interval timers 




The initial thread of the new process shall inherit at least the following attributes from the calling thread:



* Signal mask (see `sigprocmask()` and `pthread_sigmask()`)





* Pending signals (see `sigpending()`)




All other process attributes defined in this volume of `POSIX.1-2017` shall be inherited in the new process image from the old
process image. All other thread attributes defined in this volume of `POSIX.1-2017` shall be inherited in the initial thread in the
new process image from the calling thread in the old process image. The inheritance of process or thread attributes not defined by
this volume of `POSIX.1-2017` is implementation-defined.

A call to any `exec` function from a process with more than one thread shall result in all threads being terminated and the
new executable image being loaded and executed. No destructor functions or cleanup handlers shall be called.

Upon successful completion, the `exec` functions shall mark for update the last data access timestamp of the file. If an
`exec` function failed but was able to locate the process image file, whether the last data access timestamp is marked for
update is unspecified. Should the `exec` function succeed, the process image file shall be considered to have been opened with
`open()`. The corresponding `close()` shall be
considered to occur at a time after this open, but before process termination or successful completion of a subsequent call to one
of the `exec` functions, `posix_spawn()`, or `posix_spawnp()`. The _argv[]_ and _envp[]_ arrays of pointers and the strings
to which those arrays point shall not be modified by a call to one of the `exec` functions, except as a consequence of
replacing the process image.

The saved resource limits in the new process image are set to be a copy of the process' corresponding hard and soft limits. 


## Return value


If one of the `exec` functions returns to the calling process image, an error has occurred; the return value shall be `-1`,
and `errno` shall be set to indicate the error.


## Errors


The `exec` functions shall fail if:


 * `E2BIG` - The number of bytes used by the new process image's argument list and environment list is greater than the system-imposed limit
of `ARG_MAX` bytes.

 * `EACCES` - The new process image file is not a regular file and the implementation does not support execution of files of its type.

 * `EINVAL` - The new process image file has appropriate privileges and has a recognized executable binary format, but the system does not
support execution of a file with this format.

The `exec` functions, except for `fexecve()`, shall fail if:


 * `EACCES` - Search permission is denied for a directory listed in the new process image file's _path_ prefix, or the new process image file
denies execution permission.

 * `ELOOP` - A loop exists in symbolic links encountered during resolution of the _path_ or file argument.
`ENAMETOOLONG`

The length of a component of a pathname is longer than `NAME_MAX`.

 * `ENOENT` - A component of _path_ or file does not name an existing file or _path_ or file is an empty string.

 * `ENOTDIR` - A component of the new process image file's _path_ prefix names an existing file that is neither a directory nor a symbolic link
to a directory, or the new process image file's pathname contains at least one non- <slash> character and ends with one or
more trailing <slash> characters and the last pathname component names an existing file that is neither a directory nor a
symbolic link to a directory.

The `exec` functions, except for `execlp()` and `execvp()`, shall fail if:


 * `ENOEXEC` - The new process image file has the appropriate access permission but has an unrecognized format.

The `fexecve()` function shall fail if:


 * `EBADF` - The `fd` argument is not a valid file descriptor open for executing.

The `exec` functions may fail if:


 * `ENOMEM` - The new process image requires more memory than is allowed by the hardware or system-imposed memory management
constraints.

The `exec` functions, except for `fexecve()`, may fail if:


 * `ELOOP` - More than `SYMLOOP_MAX` symbolic links were encountered during resolution of the _path_ or file argument.

 * `ENAMETOOLONG` - The length of the _path_ argument or the length of the pathname constructed from the file argument exceeds `PATH_MAX`,
or pathname resolution of a symbolic link produced an intermediate result with a length that exceeds `PATH_MAX`.

 * `ETXTBSY` - The new process image file is a pure procedure (shared text) file that is currently open for writing by some process.
