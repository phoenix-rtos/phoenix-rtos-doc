## Status
Partially implemented
## Conformance
IEEE Std 1003.1-2017
## Description


The `rand()` function shall compute a sequence of pseudo-random integers in the range `[0, RAND_MA]`  Â with a
period of at least `232`. 

 The
`rand()` function need not be thread-safe. 
 The `rand_r()` function shall compute a sequence of pseudo-random integers in the range `[0, RAND_MA]`. (The value of
the ``RAND_MA`` macro shall be at least `32767`.)
If ``rand_r()`` is called with the same initial value for the object pointed to by _seed_ and that object is not
modified between successive returns and calls to `rand_r()`, the same sequence shall be generated. 
The `srand()` function uses the argument as a seed for a new sequence of pseudo-random numbers to be returned by subsequent
calls to `rand()`. If `srand()` is then called with the same seed value, the sequence of pseudo-random numbers shall be
repeated. If `rand()` is called before any calls to `srand()` are made, the same sequence shall be generated as when
`srand()` is first called with a seed value of `1`.
The implementation shall behave as if no function defined in this volume of POSIX.1-2017 calls `rand()` or
`srand()`.


## Return value


The `rand()` function shall return the next pseudo-random number in the sequence.
The `rand_r()` function shall return a pseudo-random integer. 
The `srand()` function shall not return a value.
