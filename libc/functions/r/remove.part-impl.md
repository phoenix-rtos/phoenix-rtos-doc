## Status
Partially implemented

## Description


The `remove()` function shall cause the file named by the pathname pointed to by _path_ to be no longer accessible by
that name. A subsequent attempt to open that file using that name shall fail, unless it is created anew.

If _path_ does not name a directory, `remove(path)` shall be equivalent to `unlink(path)`.

If _path_ names a directory, `remove(path)` shall be equivalent to `rmdir(path)`.
