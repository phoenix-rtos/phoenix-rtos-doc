## Description


The type DIR, which is defined in the `<dirent.h>` header, represents
a directory stream, which is an ordered sequence of all the directory entries in a particular directory. Directory entries
represent files; files may be removed from a directory or added to a directory asynchronously to the operation of
`readdir()`.

The `readdir()` function shall return a pointer to a structure representing the directory entry at the current position in
the directory stream specified by the argument _dirp_, and position the directory stream at the next entry. It shall return a
`null` pointer upon reaching the end of the directory stream. The structure _dirent_ defined in the `<dirent.h>` header describes a directory entry. The value of the structure's
`d_ino` member shall be set to the file serial number of the file named by the `d_name` member. If the `d_name`
member names a symbolic link, the value of the `d_ino` member shall be set to the file serial number of the symbolic link
itself.

The `readdir()` function shall not return directory entries containing empty names. If entries for dot or dot-dot exist,
one entry shall be returned for dot and one entry shall be returned for dot-dot; otherwise, they shall not be returned.

The application shall not modify the structure to which the return value of `readdir()` points, nor any storage areas
pointed to by pointers within the structure. The returned pointer, and pointers within the structure, might be invalidated or the
structure or the storage areas might be overwritten by a subsequent call to `readdir()` on the same directory stream. They
shall not be affected by a call to `readdir()` on a different directory stream. The returned pointer, and pointers within the
structure, might also be invalidated if the calling thread is terminated.

If a file is removed from or added to the directory after the most recent call to `opendir()` or `rewinddir()`, whether a
subsequent call to `readdir()` returns an entry for that file is unspecified.

The `readdir()` function may buffer several directory entries per actual read operation; `readdir()` shall mark for
update the last data access timestamp of the directory each time the directory is actually read.

After a call to `fork()`, either the parent or child (but not both) may continue
processing the directory stream using `readdir()`, `rewinddir()`,  Â or `seekdir()`.  If both the
parent and child processes use these functions, the result is undefined.

The `readdir()` function need not be thread-safe.

Applications wishing to check for error situations should set `errno` to 0 before calling `readdir()`. If `errno`
is set to non-zero on return, an error occurred.

The ``readdir_r()`` function shall initialize the _dirent_ structure referenced by _entry_ to represent the
directory entry at the current position in the directory stream referred to by _dirp_, store a pointer to this structure at
the location referenced by _result_, and position the directory stream at the next entry.

The storage pointed to by _entry_ shall be large enough for a _dirent_ with an array of char `d_name`
members containing at least ``NAME_MAX`+1` elements.

Upon successful return, the pointer returned at _*result_ shall have the same value as the argument _entry_. Upon
reaching the end of the directory stream, this pointer shall have the value `NULL`.

The ``readdir_r()`` function shall not return directory entries containing empty names.

If a file is removed from or added to the directory after the most recent call to `opendir()` or `rewinddir()`, whether a
subsequent call to ``readdir_r()`` returns an entry for that file is unspecified.

The ``readdir_r()`` function may buffer several directory entries per actual read operation; ``readdir_r()`` shall mark
for update the last data access timestamp of the directory each time the directory is actually read.


## Return value


Upon successful completion, `readdir()` shall return a pointer to an object of type `struct dirent`. When an error is
encountered, a `null` pointer shall be returned and `errno` shall be set to indicate the error. When the end of the directory is
encountered, a `null` pointer shall be returned and `errno` is not changed.
If successful, the `readdir_r()` function shall return zero; otherwise, an error number shall be returned to indicate the
error.


## Errors


These functions shall fail if:


 * `EOVERFLOW` - One of the values in the structure to be returned cannot be represented correctly.


These functions may fail if:

 * `EBADF` - The _dirp_ argument does not refer to an open directory stream.

 * `ENOENT` - The current position of the directory stream is invalid.
