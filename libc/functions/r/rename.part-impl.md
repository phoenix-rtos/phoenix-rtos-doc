## Status

## Description

The `rename()` function shall change the name of a file. The _old_ argument points to the pathname of the file to be
renamed. The _new_ argument points to the new pathname of the file. 
If the _new_ argument does not resolve to an
existing directory entry for a file of type directory and the new argument contains at least one non- ``<slash>``
character and ends with one or more trailing ``<slash>`` characters after all symbolic links have been processed, `rename()`
shall fail.

If either the _old_ or _new_ argument names a symbolic link, `rename()` shall operate on the symbolic link
itself, and shall not resolve the last component of the argument. If the _old_ argument and the _new_ argument resolve to
either the same existing directory entry or different directory entries for the same existing file, `rename()` shall return
successfully and perform no other action.

If the _old_ argument points to the pathname of a file that is not a directory, the _new_ argument shall not point to
the pathname of a directory. If the link named by the _new_ argument exists, it shall be removed and _old_ renamed to
_new_. In this case, a link named _new_ shall remain visible to other threads throughout the renaming operation and refer
either to the file referred to by _new_ or _old_ before the operation began. Write access permission is required for both
the directory containing _old_ and the directory containing _new_.

If the _old_ argument points to the pathname of a directory, the _new_ argument shall not point to the pathname of a
file that is not a directory. If the directory named by the _new_ argument exists, it shall be removed and _old_ renamed
to _new_. In this case, a link named _new_ shall exist throughout the renaming operation and shall refer either to the
directory referred to by _new_ or _old_ before the operation began. If _new_ names an existing directory, it shall
be required to be an empty directory.

If either pathname argument refers to a path whose final component is either dot or dot-dot, `rename()` shall
fail.

If the _old_ argument points to a pathname of a symbolic link, the symbolic link shall be renamed. If the _new_
argument points to a pathname of a symbolic link, the symbolic link shall be removed.

The _old_ pathname shall not name an ancestor directory of the _new_ pathname. Write access permission is required for
the directory containing _old_ and the directory containing _new_. If the _old_ argument points to the pathname of a
directory, write access permission may be required for the directory named by _old_, and, if it exists, the directory named by
_new_.

If the link named by the _new_ argument exists and the file's link count becomes `0` when it is removed and no process has
the file open, the space occupied by the file shall be freed and the file shall no longer be accessible. If one or more processes
have the file open when the last link is removed, the link shall be removed before `rename()` returns, but the removal of the
file contents shall be postponed until all references to the file are closed.

Upon successful completion, `rename()` shall mark for update the last data modification and last file status change
timestamps of the parent directory of each file.

If the `rename()` function fails for any reason other than `EIO`, any file named by _new_ shall be unaffected.

The `renameat()` function shall be equivalent to the `rename()` function except in the case where either _old_ or
_new_ specifies a relative path. If _old_ is a relative path, the file to be renamed is located relative to the directory
associated with the file descriptor _oldfd_ instead of the current working directory. If _new_ is a relative path, the
same happens only relative to the directory associated with _newfd_. If the access mode of the open file description
associated with the file descriptor is not `O_SEARCH,` the function shall check whether directory searches are permitted using the
current permissions of the directory underlying the file descriptor. If the access mode is `O_SEARCH,` the function shall not perform
the check.

If `renameat()` is passed the special value `AT_FDCWD` in the _oldfd_ or _newfd_ parameter, the current working
directory shall be used in the determination of the file for the respective path parameter. 


## Return value


Upon successful completion, the `rename()` function shall return `0`. Otherwise, it shall return `-1`,   errno shall
be set to indicate the error,   and neither the file named by
_old_ nor the file named by _new_ shall be changed or created.
Upon successful completion, the `renameat()` function shall return `0`. Otherwise, it shall return `-1` and set errno to
indicate the error. 


## Errors


The `rename()`    and `renameat()` 
 functions shall fail if:


 * `EACCES` -   A component of either path prefix denies search permission; or one of the directories containing _old_ or _new_ denies
write permissions; or, write permission is required and is denied for a directory pointed to by the _old_ or _new_
arguments. 

 * `EBUSY` -  The directory named by _old_ or _new_ is currently in use by the system or another process, and the implementation
considers this an error. 
`EEXIST` or `ENOTEMPTY`
 
The link named by _new_ is a directory that is not an empty directory. 

 * `EINVAL` -  The _old_ pathname names an ancestor directory of the _new_ pathname, or either pathname argument contains a final
component that is dot or dot-dot. 

 * `EIO` -   A physical I/O error has occurred. 

 * `EISDIR` -  The _new_ argument points to a directory and the _old_ argument points to a file that is not a directory. 

 * `ELOOP` -   A loop exists in symbolic links encountered during resolution of the path argument. 

 * `EMLINK` -  The file named by _old_ is a directory, and the link count of the parent directory of _new_ would exceed `LINK_MAX`. 

 * `ENAMETOOLONG` -  The length of a component of a pathname is longer than `NAME_MAX`. 

 * `ENOENT` -  The link named by _old_ does not name an existing file, a component of the path prefix of _new_ does not exist, or either
_old_ or _new_ points to an empty string. 

 * `ENOSPC` -  The directory that would contain _new_ cannot be extended. 

 * `ENOTDIR` -   A component of either path prefix names an existing file that is neither a directory nor a symbolic link to a directory; or the
_old_ argument names a directory and the _new_ argument names a non-directory file; or the _old_ argument contains
at least one non- `<slash>` character and ends with one or more trailing `<slash>` characters and the last pathname
component names an existing file that is neither a directory nor a symbolic link to a directory; or the _old_ argument names
an existing non-directory file and the _new_ argument names a nonexistent file, contains at least one non- `<slash>`
character, and ends with one or more trailing `<slash>` characters; or the _new_ argument names an existing non-directory
file, contains at least one non- `<slash>` character, and ends with one or more trailing `<slash>` characters. 
`EPERM` or `EACCES`
The S_ISVTX flag is set on the directory containing the file referred to by _old_ and the process does not satisfy the
criteria specified in XBD Directory Protection with respect to
old; or _new_ refers to an existing file, the S_ISVTX flag is set on the directory containing this file, and the
process does not satisfy the criteria specified in XBD Directory
Protection with respect to this file. 

 * `EROFS` -  The requested operation requires writing in a directory on a read-only file system. 

 * `EXDEV` -  The links named by _new_ and _old_ are on different file systems and the implementation does not support links between
file systems. 

  In addition, the `renameat()` function shall fail if:


 * `EACCES` - The access mode of the open file description associated with _oldfd_ or _newfd_ is not O_SEARCH and the permissions
of the directory underlying _oldfd_ or _newfd_, respectively, do not permit directory searches.

 * `EBADF` - The _old_ argument does not specify an absolute path and the _oldfd_ argument is neither AT_FDCWD nor a valid file
descriptor open for reading or searching, or the _new_ argument does not specify an absolute path and the _newfd_
argument is neither AT_FDCWD nor a valid file descriptor open for reading or searching.

 * `ENOTDIR` - The _old_ or _new_ argument is not an absolute path and _oldfd_ or _newfd_, respectively, is a file
descriptor associated with a non-directory file.


The `rename()`    and `renameat()` 
 functions may fail if:


 * `EBUSY` - The file named by the _old_ or _new_ arguments is a named STREAM. 

 * `ELOOP` -  More than `SYMLOOP_MAX` symbolic links were encountered during resolution of the path argument. 

 * `ENAMETOOLONG` -  The length of a pathname exceeds `PATH_MAX`, or pathname resolution of a symbolic link produced an intermediate result with a
length that exceeds `PATH_MAX`. 

 * `ETXTBSY` -  The file named by _new_ exists and is the last directory entry to a pure procedure (shared text) file that is being executed.
