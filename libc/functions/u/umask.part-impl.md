## Status

Partially implemented

<!-- #MUST_BE: if function shall be posix compliant print the standard signature  -->
## Conformance

IEEE Std 1003.1-2017

## Description 
 
The `umask()` function shall set the file mode creation mask of the process to _cmask_ and return the previous value of the mask. Only the file permission bits of _cmask_ (see `<sys/stat.h>`) are used; the meaning of the other bits is implementation-defined.

The file mode creation mask of the process is used to turn off permission bits in the mode argument supplied during calls to the following functions:
* `open()`, `openat()`, `creat()`, `mkdir()`, `mkdirat()`, `mkfifo()`, and `mkfifoat()`
* `mknod()`, `mknodat()`
* `mq_open()`
* `sem_open()`

Bit positions that are set in _cmask_ are cleared in the mode of the created file.


<!-- #MUST_BE: check return values by the function  -->
## Return value

The file permission bits in the value returned by `umask()` shall be the previous value of the file mode creation mask. The state of any other bits in that value is unspecified, except that a subsequent call to `umask()` with the returned value as cmask shall leave the state of the mask the same as its state before the first call, including any unspecified use of those bits.

<!-- #MUST_BE: check what errors can cause the function to fail  -->
## Errors

No errors are defined. 

<!-- #MUST_BE: function by default shall be untested, when tested there should be a link to test location and test command for ia32 test runner  -->
## Tests

Untested 

<!-- #MUST_BE: check for pending issues in  -->
## Known bugs 

None
