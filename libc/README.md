# Standard library

Phoenix-RTOS uses its own standard C library - libphoenix. The library provides a system interface for user applications. The goal of this project is to provide IEEE Std 1003.1-2017 (POSIX) compliant and certified system interface.

## Source code

The source code of the `libphoenix` could be obtained using the following command

```bash
git clone http://git.phoenix-rtos.com/libphoenix
```

The preferred way to deal with this project is to use a Phoenix-RTOS reference project repository.
