# Filesystems

Filesystems in Phoenix-RTOS are supported using file servers. File servers are specialized servers implementing specific
communication protocols. During the start, each file server registers its port in the filesystem space.

The source code of Phoenix-RTOS file servers can be obtained using the following command

```shell
git clone https://github.com/phoenix-rtos/phoenix-rtos-filesystems.git
```

The documentation of a particular server is provided within its source code repository.
