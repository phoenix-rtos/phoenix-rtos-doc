# Filesystems

Filesystems in Phoenix-RTOS are supported using file servers. File servers are specialized servers implementing specific communication protocols. During the start, each file server registers its port in the filesystem space.

## Source code

The source code of Phoenix-RTOS file servers can be obtained using the following command

```bash
git clone http://git.phoenix-rtos.com/phoenix-rtos-filesystems
```

The documentation of a particular server is provided within its source code repository.
