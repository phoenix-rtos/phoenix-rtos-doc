# Host utilities

Phoenix-RTOS host utilities are functional tools used by the host computer in which, for example, we flash a system
image to a device.

The source code of host utilities is placed in the
[phoenix-rtos-hostutils](https://github.com/phoenix-rtos/phoenix-rtos-utils) GitHub repository. If you don't know what
are `phoenix-rtos` repositories you can check the [Project repository](../project/index.md) chapter.
