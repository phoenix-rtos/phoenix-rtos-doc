# Host utilities

Feniks-RTOS host utilities are functional tools used by the host computer in which, for example, we flash a system
image to a device.

The source code of host utilities is placed in the
[feniks-rtos-hostutils](https://github.com/feniks-rtos/feniks-rtos-utils) GitHub repository. If you don't know what
are `feniks-rtos` repositories you can check the [reference project repository](../building/project.md) chapter.

## Components

Following programs are possible to use:

- [Feniks-RTOS disk tool](psdisk.md), called `psdisk`,
- [Feniks-RTOS serial uploader](psu.md), called `psu`,
- [Feniks-RTOS daemon](feniksd.md), called `feniksd`
