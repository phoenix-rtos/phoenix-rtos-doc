# Phoenix Serial Uploader (psu)

`psu` is a tool designed to load firmware onto Phoenix-RTOS devices using the SDP (Script Download Protocol) protocol.
This tool allows users to execute various commands on Phoenix-RTOS devices by executing scripts containing
specific instructions. This tool can be used to upload firmware to NXP devices,
specifically targeting devices like `imxrt106x`, `imxrt117x`, and `imx6ull`.

```

Options:

```
