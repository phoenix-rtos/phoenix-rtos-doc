# Kernel

Phoenix-RTOS is based on the written from scratch dedicated microkernel and consists of about 20K lines of code (LoC).
Microkernel is responsible for:

* memory management
* thread and process management
* inter-thread communication and synchronization
* basic application interface implementation (syscalls)

Kernel is divided into five subsystems.

* Hal - hardware abstraction layer
* Lib - common routines
* Vm - virtual memory management
* Proc - process and thread management
* Test - internal tests for kernel subsystems

## Kernel source code

The source code of the kernel could be obtained using the following command

>
    git clone http://github.com/phoenix-rtos.com/phoenix-rtos-kernel
